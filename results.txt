hree girls around me found out, and they were cool with it. They knew I was good at other stuff, but just not at math. Got out with an A- both semesters.

PSAT was 970. First attempt at SAT was 1060, second attempt was 1140. ACT was 22.

That following summer, I retook history, A in both semesters. Well, what does any of this have to do with anything?

Although it sounds bad, I‚Äôm happy I failed those classes. Sure, my parents were pissed, but I‚Äôm happy where I currently am, and you will be too soon. Knowing my GPA, I didn‚Äôt even bother applying to any UC‚Äôs (I live in Southern California), but instead bulked up on calstates. I thought I‚Äôm never going to get in. I thought my grades aren‚Äôt the A‚Äôs colleges expect, my 3.8GPA sibling had a hard enough time getting into UC‚Äôs, and here I was with a 2.4.

Today, I got my first acceptance. Sacramento State. My friends were getting early admissions, I was in this super tense moment. It‚Äôs like I was telling myself I‚Äôll get in somewhere, yet knowing I wasn‚Äôt going to get anywhere cause I don‚Äôt have the hottest academic record. I thought it‚Äôs the end of the world. I‚Äôm going to end up going to a nearby community college, never have time to hang out with friends cause I‚Äôd be commuting, and then have my parents on my butt all year.

Your acceptance letter is coming. Your future is coming soon, and you‚Äôre going to love it when it comes. It may not be your number #1, it may even be a school you didn‚Äôt look TOO much into. Just know that whatever comes, whether it is your #1 or your #22, you have a plan. You are going somewhere. It may not be where you want to be, like me in my math class. But you will start a new life, with new people. When you‚Äôre out and about in the world in a decade‚Äôs time, NO ONE will ask you what you got on your SAT, or your AP Chemistry test, or that tough unit test in spanish.

Remember, water boils the same whichever college you go to. Whether you go to UC Berkeley or a nearby community college, you will be successful. Sure, Berkeley may be a big leap and community college may be a small leap, but you‚Äôre getting to where you want to be ‚Äî just at a slower rate. The path to success isn‚Äôt a straight line. There‚Äôs lots of bumps, lots of turbulence, and lots of tough waves.

Hold tight. Your acceptance letter is on it‚Äôs way. If not today, then tomorrow. Tell yourself that every single day. One day, you‚Äôll come home and open up your email. That email will say:

‚ÄúIt is my pleasure to offer you admission to ________________ for the Fall 2020 semester.‚Äù

Not getting accepted to colleges when you‚Äôve sat through interviews/meetings with their admissions counselors & representatives. Especially if they inflate your ego telling you that you‚Äôre a great candidate. I know it happens to a lot of people, but it hurts on a personal level lmao

## [The year is 2080...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cae0j0/the_year_is_2080/)
The year is 2080 and you're a potato farmer. You live on a dusty piece of grey land in the middle of nowhere. Every now and then, you hear the *hum* of a motor. You look up into the grey sky, squint, and make out the all-too-familiar surveillance patrol. These flying drones, bolstered by advanced satellites, monitor every square inch of the planet. Just a single step across territorial lines? You're immediately shot on sight.

&#x200B;

Orwell was right. This is what our society has turned into--a dark, dystopian world. You and your poor family know it as the all-seeing Harvard. But it wasn't always like this.

&#x200B;

During the Alumni Uprising of 2061, arguably the greatest conspiracy in history, the heads of all the world's governments systematically took full control of their respective nations. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, each one of them had, at one point or another in their lives, graduated from Harvard University. With an iron fist they clamped down on all forms of dissent and eventually consolidated society into a single global state. Originating from a mandate from John Harvard himself, the Uprising had been in the works since the early 1600s. The Harvard Alums established the Thought Police and slaughtered billions. Top scientists and government agencies from around the world unveiled previously-secret technologies that were centuries ahead of their time. This enabled the Harvard to expand its reach to virtually the entire globe.

&#x200B;

Now, you live a dreary life--on nothing but worms and repulsive protein blocks similar to those in the old classic *Snowpiercer*. Your tiny abode, made of only corrugated cardboard and true glue, collapses every other day. Despite the support you give your wife and children, they blame you. They blame you for something you did decades ago.

&#x200B;

In 2053, you were the epitome of perfect. You came from an extremely wealthy family and graduated with a 10.0 GPA. Cream of the crop. Heck, you earned a shattering 50 million dollars worth of scholarships. Elite colleges were practically on their knees begging for you to attend. In the end, you narrowed it down to Harvard and Cornell. What you did next sealed your fate. You chose Cornell. Retrospectively, by no means did it seem like a mistake; Cornell was ranked the number one university by US News and its programs were the best in the world. In fact, the first trillionaire had graduated from Cornell's class of 2024. You were so excited to be doing to such a prestigious institution. But, you would soon regret your choice. That regret would carry on for the rest of your life.

&#x200B;

Flash forward back to now. Each night as you tuck your daughter into bed, she hisses, "If you'd chosen Harvard, we would've gotten full immunity from The Purge". Then, as you tuck your son into his dirt cot, he reminds you that "We'd be living in the skyscrapers of Pyongyang if it weren't for you." And as you get into bed next to your wife, she would do what she always does. With the moon glinting off her striking eyes, she would glare at you for the rest of the night, unblinking, reminding you of the eternal pain and suffering you'd brought to your family.

## [How to take a truly effective campus tour that tells you all the things they don't want you to know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ck1ar3/how_to_take_a_truly_effective_campus_tour_that/)
Campus tours are extremely effective at getting you super hyped up about the school in the moment, but generally absolutely horrible at giving you any relevant non-googleable information about the school.

After going on 5 underwhelming, cookie-cutter tours of various campuses, here's what I did to actually learn about the colleges I ended up seriously considering. And now that I'm in school and know a few tour guides, here's some tea:

**1. Ask questions on the tour**

Your mom asking 3 times about the security on campus is super uncomfortable and I get that. But a campus tour is a conversation if you make it one, and your questions are much more valuable than your parent's. If there's something they talk about that confuses you or you want to know more, don't be afraid to ask. And for more individual questions, go up to the front and chat with the guide as you're moving from location to location. They're more likely to answer honestly if they're not talking to the whole group, too.

**2. Ask questions after the tour**

Lingering questions? Expected them to talk about something that they skipped over? When the guide says they're sticking around for anyone who has more questions, they mean it... they're getting paid by the hour. If it's a more in-depth question, head back to the admissions office and ask to speak to an admissions counselor. I did it a few times and it provided clarity on parts of the application process that I wasn't sure about.

**3. The tour is just the beginning**

The worst thing you can do after a tour is hop in the car and head home. The tour is the college equivalent of bowling with the bumpers up. They're taking you past the prettiest buildings and telling you about their best qualities. Walk around the parts of campus they didn't let you see. Go in a dining hall and maybe even eat there. Actually go inside the building where your program is housed and check out an empty classroom. Make the walk from the dorms to that building. Become a student for a few hours, see if it's comfortable.

**4. Visit relevant offices**

Colleges *love* it when one of their students goes and works for Google. Why? Because then for the next 3 years they can put "Our students go and work at companies like Google" on every brochure they hand out. They don't... just that one kid did. Actually go into the Career Center and talk to them about what resources they have for students trying to find internships/jobs and where they go. International student? Visit the international office and ask about their programs for international students. Interested in Greek Life? You get the point... but there's a real value in actually talking to someone in person rather than emailing. And no, it's not weird.

**5. Talk to *someone* in your program**

This one is absolutely key if you can do it. At a few colleges, including the one I ended up choosing, I was able to finesse my way into a professor's office. They'll give you a much more intimate view of your program, and you'll gain a lot of insight into how it's run if you ask the right questions. I did this by literally walking into the building and finding someone who looked like a receptionist/office manager and asking if there's someone I could talk to. It requires some tenacity, but I found it invaluable.

**TL;DR**

The crux of this advice is basically to take control of your tour experience and don't keep it within the confines of the university's pre-decided programming. This isn't a high school and nobody gives a shit who you are... strangers walk around college campuses all the time. Actually talk to a few people and it can make a world of difference.

## [Let's be honest](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/esu4lr/lets_be_honest/)
I absolutely HATED the admissions process, and it has completely drained me. It was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do. I can literally feel emotional and mental exhaustion, especially since I applied to 17 Colleges, that too as an International Student asking for tons of financial aid

However, this process has really really helped me discover who I truly am. I have explored myself like never before. I feel like I have an identity now. I feel more mature, more aware of the world around me. I've understood how my childhood has shaped me to become who I am today, and how my high school experiences have contributed so much meaning to my life.

The two months of hell were for the better then, I guess.

PS: I really hope I get accepted somewhere

## [Stop using Reverse Chance Me's to flex.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c2fbgw/stop_using_reverse_chance_mes_to_flex/)
It's getting really annoying. Every time I open a reverse chance me, it's just someone with a 1590 SAT and 4.73 GPA and national-level ECs asking "where can I get in?" with literally no other information about what they want in a college.

A reverse chance me is really supposed to be about finding the right colleges for you, especially colleges that don't have the same recognition as Harvard/Yale/Stanford. **If you're not putting college preferences (size, public/private, presence of greek life, etc.), intended major, desired location, etc. in your reverse chance me, you are not doing it correctly.** If you just want a regular old chance me, go to r/chanceme to flex openly with everyone else.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.

## [If you get into Harvard or MIT...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f9msa6/if_you_get_into_harvard_or_mit/)
Wouldn't you always have to worry, the rest of your career, of people finding out that you went to Harvard, MIT, Yale, etc.,  always being afraid that you become known as that person who mentions your days at an elite school prematurely?

I know I worked with several engineers who graduated from MIT, and I always took a little secret pride when I solved a problem that they failed to solve.  They were actually nice guys and fairly competent, we just had different experiences, and sometimes my experiences helped me solve a problem the could not--but to be honest, I've met a lot of engineers from Purdue, UIUC, University of Illinois at Chicago, South Dakota School of mines, Iowa State, even Mankato State, who were equally as passionate and talented.  These lower rung schools sometimes have students who:

* first gen 36 ACT who never even knew about Stanford, or going to an affordable school due to needing to help their parents on the farm, save money, etc.

I've even met engineers who went to T400 schools who:

* Became rich

* Had patents granted (plural)

* Founded businesses and launched successful product lines

* Bought a house at a young age due to less debt

* had more fun being a big fish in a small pond, using college years to do things that aren't possible once you start working (summer travel)

* become a vice president at a major corporation (that I personally know).

So, don't worry if you get rejected.  The universe might be putting you on a better path than you had hoped.

Jori Johnson took the practice SAT test as a high-school student  outside Chicago. Brochures later arrived from Vanderbilt, Stanford,  Northwestern and the University of Chicago.

The universities‚Äô  solicitations piqued her interest, and she eventually applied. A few  months later, she was rejected by those and three other schools that had  sought her application, she said. The high-school valedictorian‚Äôs test  scores, while strong by most standards, were well below those of most  students admitted to the several schools that had contacted her.

‚ÄúA lot of the rejections came on the same day,‚Äù said Ms.  Johnson, a 21-year-old senior film major at New York University, one of  three schools that accepted her out of 10 applications. ‚ÄúI just stared  at my computer and cried.‚Äù

The recruitment pitches didn‚Äôt help Ms. Johnson, but they did benefit the universities that sent them. [Colleges rise in national rankings and reputation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/united-states/2020#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) when  they show data suggesting they are more selective. They can do that by  rejecting more applicants, whether or not those candidates ever stood a  chance. Some applicants, in effect, become unknowing pawns.

You don't need to have a 3.5+ GPA or a 1300+ SAT to be here.  There are no prizes for being the smartest person here.  You don't need to be aiming for T20s or Ivies to benefit immensely from /r/A2C.

Every year many of you learn about amazing schools that you might not have otherwise considered (like Trinity, Rose Hulman, Harvey Mudd, Colorado School of Mines, and many top LACs).  But many of you also find less selective colleges that are a perfect fit for you.

Every year many of you find out about massive scholarships [like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/) that change the trajectory of your life.  SO. MANY. top students miss out on those because they have earlier application deadlines.  There is a Scrooge McDuck vault of scholarship gold just waiting for you to go for a swim - so go get it.

Every year "mediocre" students with a 1200 SAT get a near full ride to a less selective school because they were well above that school's 75th percentile and this sub helped them [build an outstanding application](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bktw1k/how_to_do_a_chanceme_and_improve_your_chances/).

Every year seniors move on and leave wholesome posts thanking this community for helping them with the process.  You don't have to be perfect.  You don't have to compare yourself to others.  Just focus on being the best possible version of yourself.

Finally, remember that this sub is not representative of all college applicants.  Most people who engage with a community about college admissions are going to be highly organized and motivated students with outstanding stats.  It's sort of like how you almost never see 3 star reviews.  If it was awesome or horrific you take the time to leave a 5 or 1 star review, but if it was Applebees, you just don't bother.  Don't let the other 5 star students here make you feel like Applebees by comparison.  Instead, take advantage of the vast knowledge and resources available here and make yourself better.

I'm a mod of a sub that commonly gets the same question repeatedly misdirected to our sub, so I thought I'd address it here: How hard is it to get into an Ivy?

The answer is that, for your purposes as an applicant, Ivy admissions are indistinguishable from a lottery.  Getting a 4.0, good test scores, and all those great ECs are the equivalent of buying the lottery ticket.  Once you've got your ticket, all you can do is hope your name gets pulled randomly out of a hat.

It's not actually random, of course, but it might as well be for all the control and visibility you'll have into the process.  There are so many qualified students applying for so few seats, the admissions offices are making decisions on differences so thin that they could split an atom.  You don't know what those factors will be any given week, much less any other year.  And you'll never know why you did or didn't get selected.

So, if this is the world you want to be in, buy your ticket and don't hold your breath.  If you get in, congratulations, you won the lottery.  If you don't get in, it's not because you're not good enough, it's because you weren't lucky enough.

Happy applications, everyone.

this may be an unpopular opinion: but you CANNOT double enroll or pay the deposits at 2+ colleges to secure your spot. I have seen 16383993 posts the last few days of you guys saying you want to double enroll. No, you cannot do that. When you fill out the common app, YOU AGREE TO ONLY ENROLL AT ONE SCHOOL. Not to mention, securing multiple spots is a waste of money, and quite frankly‚Äîdisrespectful to the school. If you are smart enough to get into a top 20, than you should be smart enough to comprehend this. If you cannot understand this, (which many of you can‚Äôt) I think you either lack common sense, or you need to make up your darn mind. You had plenty of time to make up your mind, but you have not. Everyone else is in the same exact boat as you, you aren‚Äôt special. If I see another one of these posts I might tear all my hair out. If you are enrolling at more than one school I hope you get rescinded :) peace out

## [A few words of advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/clpxr6/a_few_words_of_advice/)
Please take the advice, suggestions, and conventional wisdom here with more than a single grain of salt. I am a recent alum of a HYPSM and alumni interviewer for my school, and have several friends in the admission office there. My sister was admitted to a HYPSM c/o 2023. Despite this, I often find my comments on my main acct here downvoted because they go against the conventional wisdom on this sub with respect to T20 admissions, while stuff that I personally feel is blatantly incorrect gets dozens of upvotes. This worries me a bit though, because looking in, I see a ton of views that could be discouraging to a newcomer. With that in mind, I wanted to highlight a few things:

1. You do not need major awards (or any awards) to get into your school of choice. I'm not going to pretend they don't help - the number of folks I know from college who had some incredibly prestigious award in an obscure field was ridiculous. At the same time, I know many (myself included) who had minor, not particularly interesting awards, and a few with none. Perpetuating this myth leads to far too much stress over bagging awards in the hope it'll make a difference. Any half-decent AO will be able to tell the difference between awards you received almost incidentally while doing something you were passionate about and those you caught with your Pokeball while trying to catch them all.

2. The above still holds if you are international. I've seen that challenged quite a bit on A2C, but it quite simply does not gel with the on-campus reality. Yes, admission rates for international students are lower, and yes, their stats often need to be "better," but the vast majority of internationals at HYPSM fit within the broader profile of student seen on-campus without any additional awards or accolades.

3. HYPSM isn't everything, nor is it for everyone. I loved my time in college and would not ever want to have gone anywhere else. That being said, while better than CC this subreddit seems to have a lot of subconscious and at times conscious prestige-whoring. I see tons of people posting about what they want in a college who just plan to shotgun the T20s when they'd be far better-served and happier at a LAC or at times at a less competitive school where they could stand out in their class and be better positioned for graduate school or their careers.

4. Being smart and a legacy, URM, or recruited athlete is NOT a guaranteed acceptance. I can speak from experience here as at least one of these three applied to me (hopefully with smart as well) for at least one T20 I was not admitted to with a profile above the 75th percentile for admits on all fronts. A lot of people like to shit on these groups to make themselves feel better about themselves. Unless your granddaddy's name is on every third building on campus (and possibly even then), you are just another applicant at the end of the day, and you'll ultimately be evaluated against others just like you.

4. Just because you were admitted to a school does not make you qualified to sell essay editing services for that school. This one might be a bit controversial, but it kinda grosses me out that so many people sell these services on the basis of admission to a program. There's plenty of admits who are in fact exceptionally qualified to do so, but this is orthogonal to their admission itself.

On the flip side, there's a lot of things A2C does really well, and I felt I should point those out too!

* Understanding standardized testing isn't everything
* (Mostly) supporting others
* Generally helpful advice on affording college/finances
* Appreciation for the liberal arts
* Appreciation of non-traditional ECs

This ended up being longer and rantier than expected, but I hope this is helpful. Good luck in your college admissions processes!

## [I realized I‚Äôm a boring ass person](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ejzc9q/i_realized_im_a_boring_ass_person/)
Writing all these application essays and looking for anything interesting about me or things that have happened to me made me realize I am boring as hell.

The things I like are shopping, music, art, reading, and exercise. Problem is I‚Äôm not avid enough about any of these. I‚Äôm not a black belt karate competitor or play a competitive sport or anything unique...all I do is go to the gym and run on my treadmill. I don‚Äôt listen to some obscure indie artist, play a bassoon, or am obsessed with classical music and famous composers...I just like pop music.

I always thought I had a lot of personality but it feels impossible to get that through. On paper I‚Äôm as bland as an A4 sheet of paper.

Rip me, a basic bitch 2020

## [Why we should be nicer to recruited athletes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cbj2y2/why_we_should_be_nicer_to_recruited_athletes/)
I have a friend who was accepted to NYU for theater. She spent her high school years devoted to auditions, rehearsals, performances, and honing her craft as an actor. She didn't apply to NYU with a 1500+ SAT, 4.0 GPA, or outstanding ECs. She was accepted because she showed extraordinary merit in a non-academic field that NYU values.

I have another friend that was accepted to Columbia for womens' track. She spent her high school years immersed in tryouts, practices, meets, and honing her skills as an athlete. She didn't apply to Columbia with a 1500+ SAT, 4.0 GPA, or outstanding ECs. She was accepted because she showed extraordinary merit in a non-academic field that Columbia values.

When I hear people talk about Friend A they call her "gifted," "incredible," and deserving of her spot at NYU. But when I hear people talk about Friend B, they say she "only got in because of track" and imply she isn't worthy of her acceptance to Columbia. But what's really the difference between these two paths? There is as much pressure, competition, and intensity to become a recruited theater student as a recruited athlete. Why do we assign drastically different merit to Friend A and Friend B?

Point is, there are multiple paths to college acceptances. Dismissing student athletes as "unworthy" isn't fair, and I hope we can change the way we view them in the admissions process.

 I (17 m) had my SAT test today. The proctor (25 f) was smoking hot, and we really hit it off. She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me ‚Äúthe look‚Äù left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours, and most of our conversation wasn‚Äôt even remotely about the test‚Äîjust random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the SAT test, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It‚Äôs as though I completely forgot that this was an SAT test, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my SAT test and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?

## [From a disillusioned Harvard admit- Getting into your dream college won't solve all your problems.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/el4kgu/from_a_disillusioned_harvard_admit_getting_into/)
About one month ago, I was accepted into Harvard. The overwhelming sense of relief, elevated feelings of self-importance, and the cheers of my friends and family surrounding me made me happy, but only for about a week.

 Now, I only feel empty and hopeless. For the past 4+ years of my life, my life was centered around gaining admittance to a top-tier university. I did everything in my power to maximize my chances- I joined the "right" extracurriculars and talked to friends of my parents who were college counselors to advise my "game plan" for high school. Sophomore year, I decided that I would try to get into HYPSM as a History major to maximize my chances of getting in. Previously, I was mostly interested in Science and Technology, but I knew that it would be nearly impossible to get into HYPSM applying under those majors.

To achieve perfect grades, I studied relentlessly at the expense of my health. I have pulled a dozen all nighters, skipped lunch and class numerous times to study for tests, and have even bought drugs to cope with the grueling amount of work at my extremely competitive magnet school. Now, I have constant headaches from abusing these, and constantly have trouble focusing on schoolwork due to the dependency I have developed on Adderall and Nicotine.

My passions and hobbies, including drawing, piano, and programming all died out because they wouldn't be "useful" to me in the college process. After all, what college needs another Asian pianist who codes? Replacing my genuine interests were research positions, internships, and extracurriculars all "centered" around my application as a history major. I became the editor-in-chief of publications I didn't care about, created a phony nonprofit that I didn't really want to be a part of, and took classes in subjects that bored me to death.

Knowing that athletics weren't worth the time commitment for what I was putting down on my resume for college, I stopped playing badminton and track in the interest of freeing up more time for studying. I used to pride myself for my athleticism. Now, I am terribly out of shape and am extremely insecure about my body image.

My social life also plummeted- I can't recall ever attending a social event since my sophomore year of high school.

I've missed out on many distinctive experiences of adolescence- I have never so much as flirted with a girl, much less dated or kissed one. I still haven't learned how to drive. I've never thought deeply about my career plans. All throughout high school, I thought that everything would be worth it once I got into HYPSM.  All I know now is that I am lost and hopeless.

Please don't make the same mistake that I did. Live. Go to parties. Ask your crush out on a date. Take risks. Make mistakes. Follow your true passions.

A college name won't make your life worth living- only you have the power to do so.

Edit: for those PMing me, I do not go to TJHSST. I go to school in Texas, but I won‚Äôt disclose which one for privacy.

## [Juniors - Harvard sending you mail literally means nothing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/frr16n/juniors_harvard_sending_you_mail_literally_means/)
Last year around this time, Harvard sent me a packet asking me to apply. I was in the shower and my mom saw it. She proceeded to take a picture of it and send it to every family member. We didn‚Äôt have plans for spring break (this happened like two weeks before it) and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúlol now we need to go to Boston.‚Äù Since it was spring break for most schools around the country, they had no tours. She literally made me email the office of admissions and like ‚Äúummm excuse me but I got a package from you! You need to get me on a tour!‚Äù And they said ‚Äúno peasant.‚Äù We ended up taking a trip to the northeast to do visits (not at Harvard lol)

Anyway, getting letters/packages from schools like Harvard mean nothing. If you hadn‚Äôt heard of this already, here‚Äôs what happens:

Harvard (along with other schools) want to have as low as an acceptance rate as possible. They don‚Äôt want to decrease the size of incoming classes so therefore they have to have a large applicant pool. How do they do that? Sending thousands of high schoolers letters encouraging them to apply. Kids think ‚Äúwow! Harvard wants me!‚Äù But no, honey. They just want your application.

I‚Äôve been binge-watching videos of people reading their essays, and in addition to this, I‚Äôve been reading some online. What I‚Äôve noticed is that people go into minute detail about something so oddly specific. They paint these overly descriptive scenes, going on tangents about what they smelled, felt, and saw. I swear I saw an essay where a student described the texture and curve of a tree branch, and never mentioned it again. I‚Äôm just so confused about why so many college essays seem like a creative writing piece. Has anyone been admitted to a good college without having elaborate never-ending sentences that don‚Äôt contribute to the message/narrative?

## [5 Most Overdone Essays and How to Avoid Them](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cezbly/5_most_overdone_essays_and_how_to_avoid_them/)
Hey everyone,

Based on your feedback, it seems like a lot of you are curious about what the most common essay structures are and what are topics to generally avoid for top schools. You know, I‚Äôve always found it fascinating how rapidly the admissions process changes every year, and how behind the general public is at catching up. The essay advice I see online now is about 5-6 years late. It‚Äôs 2019, nobody‚Äôs writing about dead pets or mission trips to Africa anymore.

The following represents some of the essays that I have found to be the most overdone ranked from most common to least. One disclaimer I want to make is that essays, while vital, are not the only factor for a student's success. There are also ways to make these work, though I generally tell students not to try since they‚Äôre more difficult targets to hit. Lastly, these reflect my own experience, and I‚Äôll bet that another reader in another office might have a different set of essays he/she/they are tired of reading.




**The Most Common Essay Structure, Period**

This essay outline has become the most popular over the past 3-4 years or so. I‚Äôm not sure why, but it goes something like this:

1. First standalone sentence that‚Äôs supposed to ‚Äúgrab the reader‚Äôs attention‚Äù I guess. *The electricity in the room was palpable.*

2. Following that, the first narrative paragraph explaining/revealing the context and situation. *Got it, so you‚Äôre at your state debate tournament.*

3. Montage paragraph describing your journey from the beginning to this moment. *You joined your debate team and were elected team captain.*

4. Jumping to the present and wrapping up your story. *Hurray, you won an award and/or placed well.*

5. End with a personal takeaway that doesn‚Äôt look any different than the last hundred essays I‚Äôve read about your sport/club/instrument. *You weren‚Äôt confident in yourself initially, but now you learned to accept yourself and are thriving as a result. You were scared to be in a new environment, but now you feel comfortable and have assimilated into a new team.*

Now fundamentally this structure makes sense and performed well years ago. It builds suspense, it weaves in and out of time like an action movie. The problem I find is that many of these essays 1) follow this structure exactly with no variation and 2) have nothing of substance to say. It gets tiring. Instead of having exactly this outline, I would recommend that students try to build upon this or use this as a launch pad.




**First-World ‚ÄúWoe-is-Me‚Äù Essays**

Nobody‚Äôs writing about dead pets anymore, but the general idea is still showing up. Many middle-class to upper-class students make the focal point of their Common Application about issues they face that a reader is just not going to care about. The larger problem is that students will write about these mundane problems with complete and utter sincerity. Examples include minor maladies or ailments, ‚Äúfinancial issues,‚Äù difficult teachers etc.

There are two problems with this approach:

1) You‚Äôre operating under the assumption that gaining sympathy from your readers will help you gain an acceptance. This is not going to be true when you are in these social classes. Exceptions do exist, but only for applicants with extreme familial and financial situations. Most of you writing these essays do not originate from such a background.

2) We‚Äôre not stupid. Students will often write about financial inconveniences or having a lack of educational resources even though they grew up in a nice, upper-middle class suburb with a solid school system. We can generally tell what your income is based on your activities and we know your region from previous cycles. At best, your reader is confused about your story and background. At worst, they think you‚Äôre exaggerating your circumstances.

Generally, writing about difficulties you‚Äôve faced is completely doable as long as you have something interesting to say and can relate to your reader. I just don‚Äôt want to read 650 words about how hard it was growing up with braces, especially when millions of children across the globe don‚Äôt have access to dental care.




**‚ÄúQuirky‚Äù Essays with No Substance**

I blame all those wacky viral essays on Business Insider (the most useless site ever) or whatever.

If you ask anyone in this subreddit, everyone ‚Äúknows‚Äù that it is important to be unique and differentiate yourself. What makes you special, what can you bring to campus etc. The problem is that many of these essays tend to focus more on ‚ÄúHey look at me, I‚Äôm different!‚Äù rather than having something substantive to say.

The core issue is that students tend to come across as inauthentic. Being genuine and sincere in your essays is one of (if not the most) important things colleges look for, and writing about oatmeal or staplers or some other random object really makes me question whether I like you or not.

So that‚Äôs the logical reason. From my experience, sometimes admissions officers just won‚Äôt like you because you come across as plain weird. You might think your Hearthstone Twitch channel or yo-yo skills are cool, but a lot of readers just won‚Äôt care.




**Tragedy**

Unfortunately, tragedy is very common. I‚Äôve read hundreds of essays about friends‚Äô suicides, parental deaths, abuse, bullying, assault etc. The issue from an admissions perspective is that 1) there are so many similar ones that it‚Äôs difficult to differentiate you from others in the pool 2) generally, you spend the entire essay talking about other people rather than yourself 3) students often have nothing new or innovative to say about said tragedy. I know this is unfortunate, but this is just the nature of seeing these essays year after year for a long period of time. People don‚Äôt care about sob stories anymore on American Idol either.

Personally, I think that tragedy, if included, should not be the focal point of your essay. Weave it into a larger structure, and make it more about yourself and how the circumstances you faced have changed your perspective. Plenty of students nail this part and perform very well in the overall process as a result.




**Food/Recipe essays**

There‚Äôs two common food essays I‚Äôll see:

1) Metaphor using a particular recipe (lasagna, dumplings etc.) to highlight an applicant‚Äôs different qualities through layers or steps. This one‚Äôs more common, and just lazy at this point.

2) Recipe or special food that has been passed down in the applicant‚Äôs family (usually grandparents) through cooking together

This surprised me when I first started reading applications, but it makes sense‚Äîregardless of culture or class, everyone loves food.



Lastly, a lot of you have asked me about the Costco essay that ‚Äúgot‚Äù a student into 5 Ivies. Look, if you are not also a Hispanic + African-American applicant like her, then I would not consider the essays or resumes of those who are as an appropriate resource. Use previous applicants to your advantage only when they match your own profile. Personally, I thought the essay was a fun read, somewhat refreshing albeit a little insincere and flowery, and would not consider it in the top tier of essays I‚Äôve read.



Anyways, hope this was helpful. I really liked a few of the other suggestions (what exactly does ‚Äúfit‚Äù mean at an elite school AO, common myths etc.) and really wish I could include everything. More coming in the future!

## [Celebration Megathread I: Fall 2019 ED/EA/Rolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e1jjqi/celebration_megathread_i_fall_2019_edearolling/)
It's that time of year again! As you open that letter or email and receive the good news, post in this thread to share your excitement with others. We will also be creating megathreads for each school on request.

If you want an official megathread for a particular college, send me a PM or comment below with the college's name and, if you have it, the exact date and time of the decisions release.Please give me ample time (~1-4 days before the decision date) to create your megathread, otherwise, the results might come out before I am able to fulfill the request.

College acceptance megathreads will be listed below, as well as expected release dates and times for those not yet released. If you have any information about release dates, please send me a PM/leave a comment with that information so it can be included in this thread.

###DO NOT create a new thread about your acceptances or an unofficial school megathread. Such threads will be removed on sight.

We're excited to celebrate your achievements with you!

## [Toxicity on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpwqdf/toxicity_on_this_sub/)
Especially after Ivy Day, I am so done with elite kids who think that the Ivy League is the only place to be and essentially worship it, while at the same time saying to every other redditor that 'Purdue is so good!' and 'omg, Penn State! It's what you make of it!'
All schools are good. If you're the ones that are all 'worried' about what happens if you don't get in, because 'my parents went there and my whole family went there and I could NEVER go to any of my safeties' then don't tell others that their college is a perfect choice. Actions speak louder than words, so be careful about saying 'iT's WhAt YoU mAkE oF It' when you don't follow that advice yourself.

Edit: wow guys, thanks for the reaction. One thing I want to clean up: *you are not automatically a bad person if you go to an elite school*. Plenty of good, kind people go to T20s. Just try not to lord your school over others'.

## [Harvard rejected my acceptance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c2agxy/harvard_rejected_my_acceptance/)
Harvard decided to reject my application for a grade received over two years ago.

I failed Honors English II due to not completing my either my final exam or my final essay for the class. I was an immature teenager, only 16, and I have grown so much in the events in my life that have ensured. I am not the student that I was two years ago, and for them to use that to reject me is unfair.

If Harvard is suggesting that growth is impossible and that our past defines our future, then Harvard is an inherently hypocritical institution. Countless Harvard faculty have stressed the importance of failure for future growth and success.

I hope society doesn‚Äôt encourage this kind of judgement on the past. This is a sick reminder of where we stand as a people, and I hope you can side with me in encouraging a society of forgiveness rather than exile.

## [Just got into a huge argument with my parents over not wanting to go to MIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fw9eb7/just_got_into_a_huge_argument_with_my_parents/)
I just filled out the USC Housing application and got to the page to submit the $55 application fee... apparently talking to my parents about deciding between multiple schools didn't make it clear enough to them that I wasn't going to automatically commit to MIT. I was bombarded with 30 minutes of yelling, accusing me of "being a pussy," "being retarded," and "having serious mental health issues" in Chinese (Damn, what a failure I must be for that).

Obviously I was insanely happy when I got into MIT. I was over the moon for about an entire month. But after that initial euphoria went away, I began to really process what going to a school like that would mean. I've worked insanely hard for my grades in high school, and I was never the type that would be able to not study for tests in order to excel. I always felt stressed out by everything, and the "college resume building" aspect of my life took over my entire mindset. Although I've never had the guts to go to a therapist or seek professional medical attention, I'm sure I've experienced depression and anxiety far too many times during my four years in high school.

Through more research online and talking to current/former students, I've come to realize that MIT truly might destroy me. I'm already extremely fragile mentally, and the advice I've heard over and over again is to not go to school if you fall apart under stress. Sure, the graduation rate is extremely high and I'll probably be able to make it through, but at what cost to my mental health? High school has already broken me many times -- how is MIT not going to be even worse? The only thing I realized I truly like about MIT is the prestige associated with its name... and that's precisely why I don't want to go there right now.

When I tried to tell my parents my thinking, they refused to even contemplate the reasons as to why I'm having doubts in terms of attending this \*magical school\*. They told me every college would be hard, and while that's certainly true, is it possible to deny the fact that MIT will almost certainly be more intense and riskier for my health than other, "worse" schools? The campus made me feel miserable when I visited, the horror stories I've heard have scared the shit out of me, and I honestly can't see myself enjoying my time at MIT. But my parents said that "MIT is too prestigious for you not to go," that "there is a reason why their yield rate is so high," that they "couldn't stand to talk to me again if I chose to go such a bad school like USC."

Maybe I did this to myself. My entire life, I've been a sheep to my parents. I listened to them when they insisted I needed straight A's since the beginning of middle school. I listened to them when they told me I couldn't hang out with my friends during the school year because a "good, smart Chinese boy had better things to do with his time." I listened to them when they told me that a "perfect ACT/SAT score will set you up for your entire life." I even almost listened to them when they told me to quit playing a sport, literally the one thing that has kept me sane throughout the past 6 years of my life. Now, they expect me to blindly listen to them again. But this time, I can't.

I don't know what to do. I know that I will probably regret passing up the insane academic opportunities at MIT if I don't go. I know that I might never be able to heal my relationship with my parents if I don't go. I know that, if MIT doesn't destroy me, it is probably the best choice for me to go to college. But how do I know that it won't destroy me? I can do more research, but how can I know for sure that I will be fine if I go there? How do I make the right decision? I can't even discern my own thinking from that of my parents. I don't even know how to end this rant. I'm just a giant freaking mess. I feel stuck.

Hello everyone! I‚Äôve been a long time lurker on this sub and I see sooooo many of the posts about Ivy League schools and schools of that nature.

When I was in high school, I had a 4.0, 35 ACT and a million EC‚Äôs. Got into a few higher schools.

I ended up going to a state school because I liked it the most. It has a pretty high acceptance rate, but I don‚Äôt mind. I just want to let you all know that if you are only going to a higher up school for the clout, just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt.

Good luck to you all, I hope you all get into your dream schools! üòä

## [As app season winds down, I'm realizing we might've made college a much bigger deal than it really should be](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ehh80p/as_app_season_winds_down_im_realizing_we_mightve/)
I grew up with Asian parents who always daydreamed about me going to a prestigious college; my mom would often tell me how she hoped she'd be able to one day buy merch saying "UC Berkeley Mom," etc. From a young age, I was given this idea that college was my ultimate end goal after 18 years and that my focus should be on maintaining perfect grades and academics in order to get into a good school. And at the start of high school, I legitimately thought I wouldn't even make it to my local community college, because my parents had instilled this idea in me that college was an impossibly lofty goal; I guess it was their (unhealthy) way of "motivating" me.

But as I progressed through HS, I started to realize that there are so, SO many options for after high school; there are so many colleges and universities out there with good programs that lead to promising career prospects and futures. Just because a school isn't top 10 on US News doesn't mean you can't be insanely successful upon graduating from there.

Having a dream school is great, but being rejected isn't even close to the end of the world. I guess as I worked through my apps this year, I started realizing that for some of us, we've placed all this emphasis on being the perfect candidate for admissions - taking a ton of AP and honors classes, joining a bunch of extracurriculars, taking on more than we can handle at times, sacrificing sleep, social life, and sometimes our sanity just to maintain grades, etc. There's a lot of competition and peer pressure too: comparing stats, number of AP classes, amount of extracurricular involvements...but here's a hot take: maybe that wasn't all that necessary. So what if you don't get into a school that's seen as "prestigious" based on some arbitrary ranking? Prestige isn't everything; and honestly, the quality of the programs at different schools isn't all that drastic. Plus, if you really think about it, college is only the next 4 years of your life. Think about how quickly the 4 years of HS flew by; it'll only feel faster in college. My point is, college is really just a fleetingly short part of your future, and afterwards, what really matters is what you make of and do with what you learned from your college experience.

When I was in the midst of it, it seemed totally reasonable to stress myself out over my grades, stats, essays, extracurriculars, and on and on, but stepping back a little bit and looking through a different perspective, you start to see that this all is just a tiny piece of your future. Whether you go to Harvard or your state school or community college, you're making efforts to better yourself through education. And that is a respectable commitment that you should be proud of. Plus, the vast majority of people don't go to these so-called T20 or T50 or even T100 schools and they are doing just fine in life. **I feel as if we've put certain schools and the high stats/impressive resume that comes with those on a pedestal, but that's really not an accurate portrayal of reality at all.** Stop beating yourself up over not having a 1500+ SAT or a 4.0 GPA. In the long run, this all doesn't matter as much as it can seem right now. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk :)

EDIT: Thank you for the silver! I didn't expect this post to blow up but I'm glad you guys could make something out of my disorganized thought dump haha

## [I was rejected by every college I applied to last year (except for a safety). Here is my story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fs5903/i_was_rejected_by_every_college_i_applied_to_last/)
This is a bit long but I hope you read all of it if you need encouragement.

DISCLAIMER: I did this in a rush so my grammar isn't spot on and I hope religious indifferences don't stop you from encouragement. There is so much more to my story but to keep things simple, I've cut out a lot of detail. I am also not one of those students who didn't have any extra-curricular activities.

It is December 2013 and the Christmas spirit is felt throughout Seoul, South Korea. Festive lights glitter and Korean covers of Mariah Carey‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll I Want for Christmas Is You‚Äù echo throughout the snowy winter night. The streets are empty as everybody is home getting ready to go to bed. I witnessed this Christmas ghost town shivering on a park bench. My mother had just kicked me out of the house. Tears froze on my 7th-grade cheeks as I cried myself to sleep. I was too young to realize that my mother‚Äôs irrational punishments were due to her scapegoating her stress on me. I wouldn‚Äôt stay out for more than one night as my mother would always eventually let me back in. But coming back home wasn‚Äôt safe either. I faced physical and emotional abuse from my hot-tempered father. In bursts of anger, he would punch my face, kick me against walls, and put me in chokeholds. His favorite thing to say to me was that my dog was more important to the family than me. That year, I attempted suicide 7 times. I tried poisoning myself with shampoo, hanging myself, holding a knife to my chest, but I could never commit all the way because I was scared to go to hell. I prayed to God for guidance and he provided a way. My path was to devote my life to school so that a good college would want me and I could establish a bright future without the need of my parents. I held this goal every single day. I was determined.

I moved back to California for high school but that didn‚Äôt change anything about my life. I still faced abuse from my parents but I continued to hold onto my goal. Whenever I would get physically and emotionally abused, I would cry to sleep until my parents went to bed. I would then do my homework all night in peace. Whenever I would get kicked out of the house, I would immediately go to the library to study and spend my nights at a friend‚Äôs house(Fun fact: I spent my finals week during my sophomore year sleeping on my friend's couch). My classmates would tease me and call me ‚Äúdepresso boy‚Äù but I stayed strong and focused. I didn‚Äôt get a car until the last week of my junior year so I commuted everywhere on the public bus. I used my hour commutes to continue to study. I never had an allowance from my parents so I hustled on the side to financially support myself. I stayed determined and it showed through my good grades.

But things took a huge turn during my junior year. I gave my parents a second chance and called them out for their harassment of me in hopes of reconciliation. My mother broke down and apologized but my father called my feelings a joke. That is when my parents decided to go through a divorce. Throughout my junior year, my father put the blame on me for a broken family and told me to give up on my college dream because I wouldn't be receiving any financial support from him. This tormented me while I took my ACT. I was on the brink of giving up. The divorce never went through because of family interventions hosted by my extended family. Then one Sunday morning, days before my senior year, I woke up with food poisoning. My father told me that morning to walk my dog in which I said yes. However, I was stuck in the bathroom for 30 min with my illness so my sister unknowingly took my dog out. My father responded by putting me in a headlock and throwing me down the stairs. He then screamed at me to leave the house and never come back. I was fed up with the years of abuse from my father so I finally stood up to him. He, of course, hung me by my hair and started attacking my face. He then finally threw me out. Heartbroken and scared, I called the police for help in which they put me in a hospital and I got assigned a social worker.

I spent my senior year living with my aunt. Being separated from my family didn‚Äôt stop my goal though. I actually performed better at school due to the absence of abuse from my father. I got a 97% or above for all my classes that first semester. At that moment, I thought my life was finally turning around. I was wrong. With a 34 ACT and around a 4.5 GPA, I was rejected from UPenn, USC, UCLA, UC Irvine, UChicago, and NYU. The last college I had to hear from was UC Berkeley, my dream school. It was a Wednesday and my last class was AP Econ. During the last 10 min of class, UC Berkeley released the admissions. I watched 3 students in my class cry with joy as they got accepted. My body shook incredibly as I knew this was my last chance at my 6-year goal. After school, I drove straight to my local church. I got out of my car and walked to the church building. I put my hand on the building wall and began logging into my UC Berkeley portal on my phone. I did one last prayer and then opened my result. I was rejected. I waited to see tears drop onto my screen but it didn‚Äôt happen. I stood there, with my hand on the church building, motionless. I remember my whole body was numb and shaking uncontrollably. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. All my hard work, all the pain I endured, all the frustration I pushed aside was for nothing. As I finally drove back home, I realized I should just committed suicide when I was 12 years old to save me from 6 years of pain.

I never did commit suicide because I did get accepted into SDSU. After all those rejections, I didn‚Äôt feel abandoned by God. I knew I still had a path with SDSU and that this path is for good reasons just like how the pain I endured for all those years has built me into a strong person with incredible grit.  Since I am a CA-resident, I can pay for own tuition with the money I made through my business and loans.

Don't let college admissions define your life. It is YOU that defines it. If you didn't get into your dream school, move on and set new dreams now. Achieve those dreams so that those colleges that rejected you regret missing out on the amazing person you have become. I believe in you. (When you achieve your dreams, I suggest going into your room and listening to High Hopes by PATD while you shed those joyous tears) Also, don't be envious of those classmates that got in instead of you. Don't think you deserved it more than them. You are bigger than that.

If you got into your dream school, I congratulate you. Nobody deserved that spot more than you because everybody deserves to be happy in life and a chance at success. Continue to work hard so that you can make your dream school proud.

## [My personal system for easily creating fun, original essay topics. Introducing: "Half-Ideas"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g37nsu/my_personal_system_for_easily_creating_fun/)
 In my experience, the majority of problems students run into with their application essays are based upon picking a bad topic. By "bad" I generally mean the topic falls into two categories:

1) Done to death

2) Too weird for its own good

The first one I can easily provide samples for: probably my most common one is running track. A lot of students run track and want to write about their experiences. That's great except that a lot of other students also run track and have similar things to say. There are only so many ways to write about track - see if you recognize any of these classics:

\- I joined track and was bad at it, but then I tried harder and now I'm good

\- I'm really good at track and here is a list of my accomplishments you already saw on my EC that prove how good I am

\- I'm just ok at track, but through the team, I have gained other skills like leadership that are important to me

\- I don't actually like track, but in being forced to do it, I learned some valuable lessons

\- Here is a live recap of me running the anchor on the 400 relay, with every student I pass symbolizing an obstacle I have conquered in life to get where I am.

That last one is a bit of a joke. But it's indicative of the problem that I think drives elite students to get so...creative in the framing devices on their essays. You students know track isn't that special, but it is something important to you, and you want to talk about it. The end result is...well‚Ä¶

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i\_think\_modern\_elite\_essays\_are\_terrible\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i_think_modern_elite_essays_are_terrible_and/)

And then the other problem is with "le quirky teen" essays. These never seem to work out as well as anyone wants. That penguin collection may be as important to you as you write about, but without anything more substantial to link those interests to, the essay falls apart.

So, what do we do about all this? How do we manage to write about what matters to us, but in a way that's still fun and original?

The answer is *half-ideas*.

"I like track because it taught me responsibility" is a half idea. So is "I have trouble sleeping when I'm nervous. So is "I collect stuffed penguins." So is "I like making people laugh and try to lighten the mood when things are hard." A half idea is anything about you or your world that you think colleges should know about. What makes half-ideas different from normal ideas is that we want to come up with these ideas with the full intention of *combing those ideas together to create an original topic.*

Some people stumble upon combining half ideas by accident. I did! I wrote an essay ten years ago that perfectly encapsulated how easy and powerful combing two ideas can be. My two half ideas for the topic were:

1. I have ADHD
2. I like to run

Either of these topics could be converted into a competent, if unexciting, essay on their own. I guarantee AOs will read hundreds of similar essays this year.  But luck would have it I combined those two half ideas a full idea that worked a lot better. All I had to do was look at those two topics and try to find a connection between them. I've found that the best connections will pop out to you. Mine did:

**How running helps me deal with my ADHD by giving me a way to quiet my mind and think clearly**

The hardest part of my ADHD is getting my brain to stop moving so fast. As quickly as I start to think about something important, that thought gets batted away by garbage. I like running because I find when I get tired enough, my brain will quiet down, and I can think about things that are important or bothering me. I get most of my best thinking done six miles into a run. That's my essay.

I guarantee there aren't many students writing that essay. By combing two ideas into a single one, I make the topic much more personal and unique. I also build myself a natural narrative structure by both presenting a challenge and a way I conquer that challenge. "How X helps me with Y" is a great way to frame an essay  Cool, right!

So let's get practical. The first step is to build as many half-ideas as possible. Just start posting as many ideas as you can. Don't worry about how you'll match them or if they're even worth matching. You've likely heard similar "just write; it doesn't matter what!" advice before, but I think that advice kind of sucks because it DOES matter what you write. With half-ideas, you should feel more comfortable posting weird factoids about yourself because you'll no longer have to worry about turning those ideas in a full essay. Just write them. Here are some sample list groups you can start with, along with as many personal half ideas I can think of for each.

**Cool stuff you've done that would make a traditional essay**

4 years Cross Country

3 Years Track

2 Years School Newspaper

4 years Parli Debate

Hosted a school zombie tag game

Active non-fiction writer

Started my own College Consulting business and made a sweet website, nbd (CollegeWithMattie.com)

**Obstacles you've overcome**

ADHD

I suffered through chronic illness in my 20s

Colorblind

**Weird "quirky" facts about you**

I love cats and have one named Penny

I love football and refuse to work on Sunday

I taught myself piano using a video game

**Positive Personality Traits**

My mom says I'm funny

I'm easy to talk to and once won a bet by speaking about my cat and college admissions for 3 hours straight

I think differently and often come up with solutions for problems no one else has (like this one!)

I see patterns well and am always looking for a more efficient way to do things

**Goals/Passions/Proof of those passions**

Want to be a private college admissions consultant

Finishing UC Berkeley certification on topic

Worked past three years as a counselor with company

10 years of writing experience

&#x200B;

That's just a short selection. Locate any "idea suggestion" posts and you will find more topics to think about.

Now that I have my list, it's time for me to look for connections between the two. Often the best value for this method comes when one of the half ideas is from the "challenges/hardships" section. This is especially true for URM or any other student with a background hook. You want to present that background but do it in a way that's more tasteful than "I grew up X, and here's why it was hard." Combine that half idea with another interest of yours, so the topic becomes "How Y helped me overcome my Childhood as X". Yay half ideas!

When looking at my list, two ideas that come to mind are my history of illness + that I taught myself piano. I decided to teach myself piano two years ago as a way of signifying that my life was going to be different now that I was better. It turned out that way, and now I celebrate my piano playing as a symbol of the fact that life doesn't take things from me anymore; I gain from it.

Pretty good topic, ya? Seeing these topics all out in front of me made it easy to compare them to one another and see what kind of connections I could identify.

Here are some bonus tips as you develop your half-idea stable:

**Your ideas don't have to share 50/50 content.**

Sometimes one topic is just more interesting than the other. Don't be afraid for a single idea to encompass 80%+ of an essay, with another idea coming in as support. Maybe you write about charity work and realize that every time you read to a kid in the hospital you leave him with one of your stuffed penguins. That's exactly why you want to introduce those penguins earlier so you can add it to your experience.

**You can even have third ideas. Whatever**

Going back to my illness/piano essay, I'd probably also want to add my wish to be a counselor in near the end. Just as I gained piano in my life, I also want to obtain success in counseling. Seeeee? It's so fun and eaaaaaasy!

**Focus on the interaction between the ideas as much as or more than the ideas themselves**

Somewhere out there is another essay involving both a love of swimming and a keen interest in robotics. Simply having two half-ideas existing in an essay is not necessarily going to make it work. Instead, I find it‚Äôs the way those ideas intertwine -the connection itself- that is most interesting. I think it‚Äôs because that connection entirely relies on you and how you view the world. That‚Äôs where the magic happens.


**Keep every half-idea about you**

This goes into advice for another blog post, but keep the focus of your essays on you. Your friends, family, famous people, politicians, and everyone else can cameo in your story, but the vast majority of content needs to be about you. The easiest way to ensure this is to keep all half-ideas that way from the start.

**You can think of half-ideas retroactively**

Write something and just feel like it's missing something? Think hard about other aspects of your life that may fit into the essay you've already written. Maybe you wrote about a big camping trip. You can bring up the fact that you're always the one who tries to keep the group calm, so when things were rough, you took it upon yourself to provide moral support. The goal is writing an essay that showcases what happens when different aspects of your life come together.

**Try to form your full topics in the form of a narrative**

Utilizing "how" is a great way to do this. How my love for paper airplanes made me a better engineer. How my daily NYT crossword puzzle influences my taste in authors. Get both topics in there and try to present one as having a causal effect on the other.

**Don't go insane**

You may have a topic or two that are awesome and don't need tinking with. Don't! This may be advice for essays 2-27 you'll be writing. Keep the list of half-ideas handy and constantly be adding to it. You never know when you'll be inspired by it.

\-

Still Hi!

My website is complete as far as all the content is on it. I plan to have someone make it look less...texty. Going forward, any info on my website can be found on my profile...or my website.

Thank you all so much for the positive feedback. It's been so fun to share my ideas with you all, and I have gotten great advice that will find its way into future posts. I plan to keep writing if ya'll keep reading.

## [Why Inspect Element Can't Reveal Your College Decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/flb31b/why_inspect_element_cant_reveal_your_college/)
Hi everyone!

Inspect element is a tool used to analyze the code of the front-end, or interface, of a website. However, a portal is **dynamic**, so it is updated with new information, such as an admission decision.

This updating of new information happens because in a dynamic webpage, the front-end code is controlled by a back-end system usually consisting of a server and databank. This is where your admission decision most likely is, and it will only show on the front-end code at a time specified by the back-end code.

Since inspect element only analyzes front-end code, it cannot see the decision until it appears on the interface you see. It cannot look into back-end databanks, the two codes are not connected in such a way.

Before you ask, no, you cant really hack into back-end code through the front-end code. They're not that seamlessly connected to eachother unless you have a gaping security issue (most universities will not)


Hope this makes sense!

**Edit**: Thank you u/questbridgehelp for the silver, and thank you everyone for taking the time to read and/or leave their input on this post. I'm seeing a lot of whataboutisms in the comments that missed the meaning of my post, but I'm glad to see that at least some people understood that its purpose was deeper than just "cheating bad" or "school is unfair".

Disclaimer: While I'm sure many of us have had wonderful high school experiences, I'm sharing my personal experiences below in hopes of either reaching out to others who have experienced the same or offering some exposure on the corruption in the high school STEM world. Please, hear me out and give me two minutes on my soapbox because I've silenced this story for a long time and decided that this subreddit would be the best platform to talk to.

I'm currently a HS senior. If you're curious, you can find my stats/ec's in my [r/ReverseChanceMe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseChanceMe/) post if you go to my profile. Some things have been kept vague to protect my identity.

I've gone to the same school district my entire life, and as my secondary school years progressed, the more and more jaded and bitter I've become. Cheating is the norm on pretty much all tests: earlier periods who've already taken the tests giving out answers to later periods, upperclassmen giving their old tests to underclassmen, storing test answers in their calculators, etc. In fact, I just took an AP Physics C test yesterday and found out, after I took the test, that half the class had the test questions prior to taking the test. Time and time again, people try to pretend to be my friend just to use me to help them with tests or copy my homework. Now, this doesn't bother me that much, because when a student cheats on a test, they usually aren't harming anyone else: they are just cheating themselves.

However, the kind of cheating and corruption that I've seen is just *filthy* and makes high school "test cheating" look so innocent.

Nothing means anything anymore; whenever I see someone in my school who is accomplished, I almost end up finding out that they've cheated to get what they have.

A couple summers ago, I dormed with a girl who got into a *very* competitive and prestigious research program at Stony Brook, but she didn't even meet the bare minimum age requirement of being 16 years old when the program started-- she was accepted because she was family friends with the program director.

I attended a class with a different girl who made National Finals of very competitive science Olympiad (similar to USACO), because she was family friends with the owners of the test-taking center, who let her take home the National Semifinals Exam (I know this because I took the exam at her test-taking center). I was in her science class (the same science subject in which she made National Finals) and it has always been evident that she struggled heavily with that subject, even in the weeks leading up to the Olympiad, so noticing that the test-taking center sent her home with the test and hearing news of her success was beyond suspicious.

Similarly, I made it to the National Finals of a lesser-known Olympiad, and was severely disappointed when I made it to its finals program. It was poorly run-- those who were allowed to select the students that would progress to International Finals were students themselves who were previous years' finalists (16-18 year olds), and they;d favor their friends and family (going as far to choose students that were their brother/sister/family friend even though they scored on the bottom 15% of tests).

The list goes on and on; I've seen students cheat from the local all the way to the international level. A couple years ago, a student from my school won an international research prize to a well-known competition, but it turns out, he has family on the board who selects the winners.

Of course, I've tried to "report" some these things, but these organizations obviously won't admit that they are corrupt, as they do not want to risk losing their prestige and legitimacy. But it's awful to know that these cheaters have cheated another, legitimate and more deserving, talented student out of their recognition. This has a cumulative effect: they don't just cheat another student out of their accolade, but also out of a spot in college (after all, winning international research prizes, attending one of the world's best research programs, making it to international finals of any Olympiad makes you coveted by T10's).

Most of the time, whenever I try bring up how corrupt high school awards are, people just brush me off as "oh well, that's life; life is unfair," and this is the most infuriatingly low-effort and pathetic response. *Of course* life is unfair, I've lived through it and worked myself to death just to witness other students get handed their accolades with minimal work involved-- they were just born in the right place to the right people.

While you can argue with me until you're blue in the face about how life is about using connections and unfair advantages, let me remind you that the organizations in question are prestigious, well-respected institutions meant to objectively measure and reward high school students' work and capabilities. And if that really is all the life is about--unfairness and corruption--then I really want no part of it.

And perhaps such prevalence of cheating--doing whatever is necessary to look make the "Honors" section of the Common App more impressive--is also an indicator of something systemically wrong with the college application process.

TL;DR: I've seen cheating from the local up to the international awards level and high school is a fucked process.

## [I tried to kiss my interviewer! Are my chances ruined?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqriom/i_tried_to_kiss_my_interviewer_are_my_chances/)
I (17 m) had my Yale interview today. The interviewer (25 f) was smoking hot, and we really hit it off. She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me ‚Äúthe look‚Äù left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours, and most of our conversation wasn‚Äôt even remotely about Yale‚Äîjust random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It‚Äôs as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for college, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my Yale application and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?

TL;DR: Tried to kiss my Yale interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up.

Edit: I just emailed my interviewer and both thanked her for the conversation and apologized again profusely. Not sure if there‚Äôs anything else I can do at this point. ‚òπÔ∏è

Edit 2: The fact that people think it‚Äôs a shitpost is only making me realize more and more just how much I‚Äôve fucked up...

Edit 3: Damn, well this blew up. The interviewer just responded to me and said she won‚Äôt hold it against me in her report and that she really appreciated my email. She also gave me several compliments in her response and said things that she really didn't have to--this convinces me that she genuinely has no intentions to ruin my application. I‚Äôll be sure to provide an update on this when I receive my decision. Also, I realize that I kind of came across as a ‚Äúsexual predator‚Äù in this post but I assure you that I am nothing of the sort. A dumbass? Yes. Predator? Absolutely the fuck not. I am fully cognizant of the stupidity of my actions but please believe me when I say that they were incited by nothing other than my misconception that the interviewer was attracted to me.

## [Any other seniors hating all the goodbyes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bsxv2i/any_other_seniors_hating_all_the_goodbyes/)
I graduate in a few days (woot!) but I've grown increasingly sad about leaving high school. I've struggled with my mental health throughout middle and high school and only really begun to make friends this year. I have gotten to know some truly amazing people, and I am going to miss them so much. I don't know how I'll stay in touch with some of them, and I hate the thought of never seeing them again. Then there are my teachers, and the extracurricular activities I won't be part of anymore. I just joined my school's bell choir this year, and I loved every minute of it. Now I'll never ring my bells again. They'll be someone else's next year. What college has a bell choir? Not mine. People say, "start one!" but who's going to pay for all the bells? I wish I could go back to middle school, when I started to isolate myself and decided not to participate in anything or make any friends and change that person's mind. It's so painful to fall in love with so many things at once and have to leave them all behind the next instant. I know I'm looking at the end of high school as the closing of a lot of doors, and there are so many more opening. I am very excited for college, just sad to have to leave the people and things I care about behind. I would suffer through high school all over again just to do it differently. The people I am friends with this year are kids I've known since middle school, and I could have been their friend all along if I'd allowed it.
This probably comes across as really negative. I really am grateful for my high school experience, and particularly this last year. I'm grateful for the goodbyes because they've made me realize who I want to be in college and how I want to approach my life. It's just hard to leave it all behind right now.

I have made a horrible, horrible mistake.

As I sit here, my college-app experience drawing to a close, I look back on my experience in high school and I now fathom how hard I‚Äôve fucked up.

I have no social life. I have very few friends, none of whom I ever see after school, I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, never been invited to parties, I‚Äôm horribly depressed, which only continues this terrible cycle. All because I needed to do homework and ECs.

I don‚Äôt want to be the diligent scholar anymore. I want to go party, I want to hang out with friends, I want to get a girl, I want to have fun. For once. And here I am, so horribly alone, as friends tear up thinking about their end of year-celebration, I do the same for my own lack of such an experience. If this is what Caltech wants, if this is what a ‚Äúgood student‚Äù is supposed to end up as,

God help us all.

EDIT: damn this blew up. It‚Äôs disheartening yet nice to see that I am not alone. I‚Äôm gonna stop replying to comments but I am both glad and saddened so many people empathize with this post.

Eventually he sat next to me and we talked about my math homework and the high school I currently go to. He asked me where I was applying and when I said Yale he said I would be admitted but I shouldn't attend because New Haven is a terrible city. He also said not to ask him how he knows.

Excited for 5pm lol

EDIT 1: Everyone doing remindme is really sweet <3 haha

EDIT 2: I forgot to mention he also said everyone at Yale is an idiot xd

EDIT 3: Got deferred! Guess he‚Äôs not a psychic lol. Well looking back he didn‚Äôt actually say I would be admitted TODAY so there‚Äôs hope for RD!!!

EDIT: Rejected RD, got into Harvard & Columbia & Brown tho, the rest of my top 4

## [A2C Abbreviation Master List, for dorks like me who didn‚Äôt know college admissions slang before joining this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f72riv/a2c_abbreviation_master_list_for_dorks_like_me/)
t10/t20/etc. - top 10 ranking, top 20 ranking (the smaller the number, the higher ranked the school)

RD - regular decision

EA - early action

SCEA - single choice early action

ED - early decision (typically binding)

REA - restrictive early action

HYPSM - Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT (basically the 5 most elite schools in the US)

WASP - Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, and Pomona; these are four prestigious liberal arts colleges.

AO - admissions officer

ECs - extra curricular activities (sports, internships, clubs, etc.)

LORs - letters of recommendation

‚ÄúStats‚Äù - GPA, ACT, sometimes includes demographic information (race, income, gender), top ECs. The joke ‚ÄúsTaTs‚Äù is often made because of how many times people tend to ask for this generic info once someone is accepted

A2C - this subreddit lol

Chance me - a sister sub to A2C where you give your stats and then people evaluate based on your stats your shot at getting into the colleges you‚Äôre applying to. Not guaranteed to be accurate because college admissions is hard to predict, but a good way to figure out how your stats compare to other applicants‚Äô stats.

Ivies - the Ivy League, which includes 8 prestigious American colleges/universities (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, Brown, UPenn). They have notoriously low acceptance rates.

LAC - liberal arts college

FA - financial aid

UCs - Includes the top California public schools, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley), etc. These are some of the best public schools around. (UC can also be University of Cincinnati, another good public school in Ohio!)

CC - community college, but can also be used to refer to College Confidential, a college blogging site

LOCI - Letter of Continued Interest, which you send to a college you ED‚Äôd to after getting deferred to let them know ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm still interested!‚Äù

Hook - something on your application that makes you stand out (I.E. a really cool extra curricular you did, a great leadership position you worked hard at, or even something as simple as a unique demographic background)

Safety - a school that you‚Äôre basically guaranteed to get into, and have a good chance at getting financial aid to, typically your local college or another state school with a high acceptance rate

Target - schools that you‚Äôre not guaranteed to get into, but a realistic goal school. These schools are different for everyone - a target might be going to your state school on a full ride (awesome!) or going to an out of state school (also awesome!). Your stats are similar to those of the average student at this school.

Reach - schools that are a long shot to get into. Ivies are a reach for anyone. These are schools where you fall in the 25th percentile of test scores or lower, or schools with low acceptance rates.

GPA - grade point average. Different schools have different scales, but most are on a standard 4.0 with weighted classes being a 5.0. GPAs can be weighted (W) or unweighted (UW)

Ivy day - a day in March where the Ivy decisions are released. May the odds be ever in your favor

FAFSA - student financial aid application! Important

EFC - expected familial contribution, calculated by the FAFSA and is based on a variety of factors, including your parents‚Äô income, assets, etc. This value predicts how much your parents could contribute financially to your college education, and estimates how much aid you‚Äôd need. Some schools (Ivies, lots of t10s and t20s) pledge to cover 100% of your demonstrated need, so that‚Äôs cool.

ABET - an accreditation important to engineering majors

CS - abbreviation for computer science. Other majors have abbreviations too, but they‚Äôre self explanatory (poli sci = political science, for example)

URM - underrepresented minority, which refers to minority ethnic, religious, or racial groups that are not as represented on campuses

ORM - overrepresented minority, which refers to minority ethnic, religious, or racial groups whose percent population on a college campus is higher than the percent population of the minority that area

OOS - out of state. Out of state students have a harder time getting into public schools as opposed to in state students. For private schools, being OOS doesn‚Äôt matter typically. Tuition is typically more expensive for OOS at public schools, but tuition for OOS and IS is typically the same at private schools.

International - students applying from outside of the U.S.

First-gen - first generation college student, which means you are the first person in your family to go to college. This qualifies people for a lot of scholarships and can be a ‚Äúhook‚Äù on an application

AP - Advanced Placement courses. These CollegeBoard courses are weighted and most students take an accompanying AP exam after completing an AP class. A score of 3/5 or greater on an AP exam can get a student college credit at lots of universities.

IB - international baccalaureate, another form of college preparatory class. Not offered as widely as AP classes are

A2C INSIDE JOKES!!

St. Anford, Stanford doesn‚Äôt exist, UC Hicago, kissing your interviewer, sTaTs. Any references to these refer to some of the most upvoted A2C posts of all time, and you can find the original jokes by sorting by all time. Inside jokes are constantly evolving!

Feel free to comment more. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but I‚Äôm not omnipotent. If you‚Äôre new to A2C, it‚Äôs helpful to know this slang!

## [After a stressful season of applications, I've withdrawn all of them and I'm not going to college](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/egq6he/after_a_stressful_season_of_applications_ive/)
Its kinda click baity but its true. I withdrew my applications to every college I submitted an application to. I decided to enlist in the Air Force instead. I swore into the Delayed Entry Program just before Christmas and I've never been happier.

Why did I decide to forego college? Its not because I couldn't go anywhere or because the military was a last resort option. I have good stats (33 ACT, 3.87 GPA, strong ECs, and several prestigious awards). It wasn't because I couldn't afford college (between savings, scholarships, financial aid, and half of a GI Bill, I could've paid for college with minimal debt.

I enlisted because I really wanted to. I haven't booked a specific job yet, but hopefully I'll end up in an Aircrew or Intelligence job. I am going to complete my Bachelor's on Uncle Sam's dime (thank you to all of you who pay taxes, its appreciated) and then get a Master's degree paid for by my GI Bill once I get out of the military. I can do all of that in about the same amount of time that it would take to finish six years of university (BA and MA) level education.

I'll be 19 years old making a decent salary with no debt and very few living expenses, complete health care, amazing opportunities, guaranteed college tuition support, and probably a Top Secret clearance.

So I urge you, if someone you know decides to forego college entirely and forge their own path, military or otherwise, support them. Don't tell them they're throwing their future away. Don't say "But you have so much potential." I'm excited about my future and the opportunity to get a Bachelor's, a Master's, and a career opportunity debt-free. I'm not throwing my future away, I'm taking a while to do what I love and reap the maximum possible benefits from it and hopefully come out ahead.

Best of luck to all of you as you select your colleges and finish your apps. I love you guys and I want the world for you.

Bye for now ‚úåÔ∏è

&#x200B;

EDIT: So a lot of people seem to think that I'm drinking the Kool-Aid. I'm not. I was born on an Air Force base and I've spent the last 18 years moving 13 times, seeing my dad go on numerous deployments and too many TDYs to count. I know it takes a toll on families (my parents are now divorced) and I know its not an idyllic patriotic heaven of all benefit and no pain. It sucks sometimes. That's okay. I know what I'm getting myself into. I'm also not getting screwed over by my recruiter. My dad used to do recruiting and has helped me cut through the BS and really get what I want. I'm gonna be okay.

Writing this is pretty surreal. Usually I come on here to look at some fire memes, but I feel like I needed to write this post after the post that I wrote.

***Some personal updates within the 24 hours:***

\- Found my passports, social security card (I didn't know my number, but will memorize it), and some other documents (got all of them scanned & will hide it somewhere else)

\- Wrote an email to colleges about the procedure to appealing aid (I don't know exactly what to do as a lot of people write about getting their request rejected, not on the procedure itself)

\- Looked at the scholarship list (thanks u/lune-etoile), found one scholarship that is for me! (going to see my principal soon so she can write me a letter of recommendation)

\- My friend's mom offered me two part time jobs tutoring kids (big plus since I only work 6hrs/week rn) It also coincides on the time the job that my mom was forcing me to do, so yay!

~~- Also got a new bank account (kakaobank), but apparently it's a limited bank account(ÌïúÎèÑÏ†úÌïúÍ≥ÑÏ¢å)? Fellow Koreans please come through as in how to change this? Ïñ¥Îñ§ ÏÑúÎ•ò ÌïÑÏöîÌï¥Ïöî??~~

Don't worry guys, again, I'm used to this. This ain't my first rodeo. Also, I didn't withdraw from any colleges, if you guys were wondering. Thank god I hesitated, otherwise, I would've lost everything. I have 6 colleges to hear back from this week (I think).

And thanks for the nice & helpful comments. ***You guys really made my day.***

p.s. If you guys have other scholarships/schools that I could apply to, please let me know. I'm a U.S. dual citizen (Korean/U.S. citizen) currently living in Korea. My major is biomedical engineering/bio-engineering.

p.s.s. I'm trying to buy a new laptop by saving some of my money. When should I buy it? Should I get it asap or buy it once I'm on campus?

&#x200B;

***update***: hey guys, thanks for reaching out. sorry if I don‚Äôt reply to your DMs fast enough. I‚Äôm cleaning the house right now üòÇüòÇ Having a dog is pretty messy.

A lot of you guys have told me to try filing for dependency override, but I still have my dad who‚Äôs income is way bigger than moms (cuz she got her hours cut for getting a face lift lol). So I don‚Äôt think that will work.

Right now, I emailed the colleges, as most of them seemed to close their campuses. Also the time difference makes it super hard for me to call them. But nonetheless, I will call them sooner or later.

***Also, no need to venmo/paypal me***. Instead, please donate to the red cross or a respectable health organization. I need this corona gone, so my hours can be extended (I currently teach 2 kids English, but my boss said that when schools start again, I should expect to get more hours).

And by the way, my name isn‚Äôt Matt. I use a pseudonym online (so I can protect my privacy). I know some yall been askin, but I ain‚Äôt gonna tell you my name üòê Sorry, I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my whole identity online.

## [UPDATE: Applying to college with a 1.4 GPA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cqakh4/update_applying_to_college_with_a_14_gpa/)
Hi everyone! I made a post last fall as a senior in HS regarding my low GPA, basically asking if I had a chance at getting into any school other than community college. I decided to log back on and update anyone who read my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9or8i0/14_gpa_do_i_have_any_chance_anywhere/) and/or cares.

I was able to get a fee waiver so I applied to ten schools. I emailed each school with a brief explanation of my circumstances and asked for my applications to be analyzed with more weight on my senior year grades than my previous three-years. Four schools told me they'll write a note about it in my file, three assured me that they review the applications holistically, and three straight up said no.

Out of the ten schools I applied to, I was accepted into two, waitlisted at two, and rejected from the other six. I interviewed with, and was accepted into a private school in my state with about an 82% acceptance rate. The second school I was accepted into has a 96% acceptance rate. One of the ones I was waitlisted to was my absolute top choice.

For a while, I considered attending the private school I got into, but I just didn't love it there, the campus feel wasn't for me and I'd have preferred a bigger school. The other one that I was accepted into is beautiful but across the country.

I decided to go with community college. I took 16 credits this summer with a 4.0, and recently began the Fall semester where I'm taking another 16. I'm applying to a few schools as a Spring 2020 transfer, including my top choice which I was previously waitlisted to, but I haven't decided for sure if I want to transfer this Spring or wait until Fall 2020.

For all those with low GPAs, for whatever reason, don't lose hope! I remember feeling so depressed about how low my GPA was. My high school was very competitive and had high standards, I used to see other girls crying in the library because their GPAs were 3.8s instead of 4.2. There is nothing wrong with community college or schools with high admission rates. If I was able to get accepted into two schools with a 1.4, you'll get into college. Don't stress too much!

## [Ranking t20s based on the distance to the closest Chick Fil A](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f9zxlk/ranking_t20s_based_on_the_distance_to_the_closest/)
Everyone has their own metrics for judging how good a school is, maybe small class size makes a school more attractive, maybe it's a great grad school, or maybe it's an insane ratio of women to men students (I'm looking at you, American!) In any case, everyone has a different perspective on what makes a college truly great, and everyone ranks colleges differently. It is because of this discontinuity that I am pleased to announce:

The A2C Ranking list of US News T20s and A Couple of Other Schools I Liked Based on their Proximity relative to Chick Fil A According to Google Maps (Or the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM for short). It is my hope that this life In this list will finally provide us with a stable metric on what ranking colleges really are. I've ranked the us news top 20 undergrad schools, along with some other schools I thought were cool. The results were as follows:

# #2: UVA, with a distance of 0.2 miles to the nearest chick fil a, it will take you approximately 5 minutes to walk there. Definitely worth it, Chick-Fil-As in the south are always incredible. Kind staff, good food, and an all-around great atmosphere, I've never been but I'm going to assume that it is amazing because it is a Chick Fil A.
# #3-5: Duke, Caltech, and William and Mary, with a distance of 0.3 miles to the nearest Chick Fil A. Big shoutouts to these schools for having super close chick fil as that you can easily walk to under the cover of buildings, so if it's raining or something you can get there while staying relatively dry.
# #6: Georgetown. Georgetown also has a distance of 0.3 miles, but it appears to be an on campus chick fil a, making it worse than normal. No good thing has ever come from an on-campus chick fil a but you gotta give them credit for trying. Nice job georgetown!
Keep in mind the top 6 all take appoximately 6 minutes to get to from the center of campus as described by google maps
# #7: Rice, with a distance of 0.6 miles, taking approximately 15 minutes to get there.
# #8-11: UPenn, American, Notre Dame, and Vanderbilt. Each is approximately 0.7 miles away from Chick Fil a, and it will take an estimated 15 minutes to walk there.
# #12: Washingotn University in St. Louis. Washington is special because you need to cut across a park to get to the Chick Fil A, which is nice and calm. It takes about an hour to walk the 2.6 miles required to get there, but it looks like a nice walk, and I wouldn't mind strolling by on a sunny day on my way to the chick fil a. Yay. Alliteration.
# #13: Johns Hopkins, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required to get there. Johns Hopkins was a pain to find because searching "chick fil a near to johns hopkins" brought me to some random road like 8 hours outside of the city so I had to find chick fil a myself by searching for chick fil as in baltimore.
# #14 Emory University, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required.
# #15: Northwestern. 3.7 miles. 1.16 hours. Keep in mind when I type like "1.16 hours" that just means 1hour 16 minutes, im just too lazy to type it all out correctly
# #16 Brown, 4.8 miles, 1.37 hours
# #17 Columbia, 5.8 miles, 2 hours. How are there not more chick fil a in new york city. That's baffling to me. glad i didn't apply
# #18 Yale, 5.9 miles, 2 hours.
# #19 UMich 6.6 miles, 2.12 hours. However, the chick fil a near UMich is an Express Chick Fil A in another university, so not only is it far away, but it's probably really bad too. 0/10 would not recommend applying to UMich. (EDIT: APPARENTLY this chick fil a is fine. nice.)
# #20 UC Hicago: 7.3 miles. 2.26 hours. I'm not gonna recommend you walk alone through Chicago at night just cuz ur hungry, but for Chick Fil A it might be worth it.

# #21 Stanford: 7.8 miles, 2.44 hours
# #22-23: Harvard and MIT, 8.8 miless, 3 hours
# #24: Princeton: 12.7 miles, 4.4 hours away. Very sad!


And now, our special mentions. You probably noticed that #1 was missing. This is due to just how incredibly small the distance is. You could practically crawl to chick fil a here, and it would still only take you about 5 minutes. With that introduction, I present to you:

# #1 UCLA! UCLA absolutely demolishes the competition with a distance of **EIGHTY FIVE FEET!!1** it would take you approximately **ONE MINUTE** to walk to chick fil a from UCLA, making it our top school in the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM ranking system.

Now, for sadder news. Coming in at last place, we have Cornell and Dartmouth.

# #24-25 Cornell: 59.4 miles, and 19 hours. Even worse is Dartmouth, with 91 miles and 34 hours walking speed. I could walk to Baltimore from my home in Virginia before I could walk to a chick fil a from dartmouth or Cornell. honestly quite shameful. very displeased.


In conclusion. UCLA absolutely owns the competition with an incredible performance, but lots of schools located in the Southeast United States give UCLA a run for it's money. Schools up north or on the west coast traditionally performed very poorly, probably because they are more liberal and hate chick fil a for some reason. buncha nerds tbh. if you want my stats here is the link to my epic spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M59TKDfW6cOLsUXsI_LvhMf2MDa51tJdzzQUZStnErg/edit?usp=sharing

if you have any questions or comments or especially corrections feel free to reply below and ill do my best to ignore you because im not editing this it was such a pain to make and im not doin it again



# extra schools (i forgot the word for like runner ups or extra but whtaever)

Arizona State University (i think thats what ASU is idk): Direct quote from carlyc999 below: "The on campus one is amazingly fast to the point where sometimes your order will be ready before you finish paying" like thats hype, u get ur food and u get out, probably really good food too, especially for an on campus location. seems like a cool place

Georgia TEch: theres one like 5 minutes away and it is in the same city that CFA is headquartered in, just drive a little bit and you get to take a tour of the HQ.

Christian universities: idk how good they are but almost all of them have chick fil as either on campus or like 5 feet away. symbiotic relationship, they feed off of each other

Hey y'all,

I've been doing some reflecting after receiving my first acceptance last week and I really just wanted to say thank you to each and every one of you. Most people in my circle sorta ended the college process in mid-December because they were accepted to their ED schools. As I was grinding on my RD apps, the people I knew in real life were chilling and taking a (well deserved) breather, which made me feel oddly alone in the process. During this time, it was super super nice to log onto here and see all of you basically going through the same things as I was. I'm super grateful for this community and I'm really excited to continue this journey with all of you. <3

After getting rejected by all schools I applied to, I lost all hope and laughed at myself for even thinking that I would get anywhere as an international needing full aid . Yet that all changed when today I opened my Harvard portal and was greeted with a "Congratulations !" This whole process just shows how unpredictable the admissions process is . Although tbh this only increases my impostor syndrome,knowing that I got rejected by all except harvard. Admittedly, I did spend more time on my Harvard app. Anyways,here is the list.

Rejected : Dartmouth,yale,yale nus ,Vanderbilt,uchicago,colby,grinnell,

## [Unpopular Opinion: A2C is a toxic sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e7zlez/unpopular_opinion_a2c_is_a_toxic_sub/)
For context, I'm a freshman in college who spent a lot of time lurking in this  sub last year. There's so much anxiety and fear over the college application process and honestly so much of it **doesn't fucking matter**. If you don't get into that prestigious-ass 1-10% acceptance rate university? You'll be fine. Seriously. Would it be great to go to a crazy good school? Sure. Definitely.  If you don't get into your "Dream School"It's not the end of the world.

I feel like this sub pushes the elitist mindset that, "you must get a 33+ ACT & have 20 different ECs & have a 5.6 GPA (how do you guys even do this? I don't think that was even possible at my school but okay?)" and I'm not here for it. This sub seems inaccessible to people with lower scores or different situations because it's very intimidating posting your stats if they are less than everyone else posting.

It also seems like this sub fosters a sort of anxious and dramatic tension. You can get lost in the worried haphazard posts talking about essays and applications, and it's draining.

I even cringe at the term "Dream School". Honestly, y'all have no freaking idea of what your dream school is like (I sure a s hell didn't going into orientation) and I've met so many people who regret their choice.  One thing I've realized in college is **how important fit is.** you should not go to a college just just because it's "the best school you can get into" because at the end of the day you need to put up with the environment you will be living in.

Learn as much as you can about the school you want to go to, and don't stress too much if you don't get into your first choice. The end of senior year will come earlier than you expect, so fucking enjoy your last year in HS.

Finally, getting into your "Dream School" over a less attractive school won't alleviate your problems. I had this mindset and boy was I in for a nasty surprise as I had to face academic hardship and a new college social scene at the same time.

Edit: misplaced words

If you have any questions feel free to ask. My interviewer said the interview would be 30-45 minutes. It ended up being over an hour. I brought a resume and transcript with he took with him. I also brought certificates and awards and other things. I would get a leather portfolios if you could, however it is not required. I wore a plain sweater with slim fitting dress pants and ballet flats. Overall, it was a great experience. I was so nervous at first. I waited in my car for about 40 minutes before I went in. My interviewer was super straight faced at first, he seemed nervous at first as well. He was well put together as expected, and was very nice. He explained what he does as an interviewer and how the process worked. His opening question was why I applied. He also asked what book I have read recently or enjoyed. He also asked who I looked up to or thought was a hero. It went well.

## [things i've learned while writing my essays...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d54yf4/things_ive_learned_while_writing_my_essays/)
1. the first draft is never perfect
2. neither is the second draft, tbh
3. nor the third draft
4. speaking of never perfect, the first idea you come with won't be the one you stick with
5. neither is the second idea
6. you get my drift?
7. don't be afraid to start over; you might like the sentence you just wrote but stop trying to shove into your essays where it doesn't fit
8. whatever you do, don't try to edit while writing. you'll get stuck on one paragraph and you'll never move on (trust me. i spent 5 hours trying to write one paragraph)
9. on a related note, don't be afraid to skip around. if you REALLY can't word something perfectly now, make a note (i like to use \[insert \_\_\_\_ here\]) and keep going. don't let it slow you down
10. if you're finally satisfied, congrats! come back to it in a day and reconsider. edit. start over if necessary. rinse and repeat.
11. balance college apps with school. don't check the time and realize it's almost midnight and you haven't started your homework
12. take everything on this subreddit with a grain of salt. it has good advice, but don't let it control you
13. take a break. walk around the house, talk to your parents, play with your pet, or switch gears. it'll clear your head and help the ideas flow better the next time you sit down to write
14. eat a snack and blame the stress
15. i like listening to white noise while i work. or lo-fi. but anything with lyrics or anything i even vaguely know the tune to? absolutely not. turn off anything that might distract you.

please add on! a lot of these have been reiterated on this sub thousands of times, but these are the things i came to realize while writing my common app essay. i am the worst at writing essays bc concentrating isn't my strong suit and i'm an obsessed perfectionist, but some of these really helped!

proof? i finally finished my rough draft last night :)

## [In light of all the Penn waitlist posts, I wanted to share my "no u" letter after Penn rejected me](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gfu1yx/in_light_of_all_the_penn_waitlist_posts_i_wanted/)
Dear Penn Admissions,


The Committee of Undergraduate Rejections has reviewed your rejection letter denying me from Penn‚Äôs Class of 2024. It is with great regret that I must inform you that I am unable to accept your rejection.


**Q**: Wait a minute, is this an appeal letter?

**A**: It is indeed.


**Q**: Can‚Äôt this schmuck read our FAQ, which says no appeals?

**A**: In the light of unprecedented events (COVID-19), I figured I‚Äôd take a risk.


**Q**: Is this for real, or a joke?

**A**: No offense taken if you have a good laugh and ignore it. Admissions officers work hard and deserve to have a chuckle once in a while. But extraordinary times call for extraordinarily gutsy decisions.


Since applying, here‚Äôs some stuff I‚Äôve been up to:


I became a mod on A2C. I can absolutely destroy your reputation for all future applicants if I don't get in, so I'm expecting my acceptance package soon. [No, I didn't actually write this, there were actual updates but obviously no one wants to read that.]


I‚Äôd also like to reiterate my interest in Penn, one of the reasons I made the difficult decision to reject your rejection. [Boring why Penn stuff goes here].


Once again, I truly appreciate your interest in rejecting me, however, I wish you the best in accommodating me for an additional spot in Penn‚Äôs Class of 2024. If an accommodation is made, I would absolutely attend. In light of the difficult circumstances of COVID-19, I am willing to accept a spot in Penn‚Äôs Class of 2025, or a transfer option after a year at another university.


Please note that this decision is not a reflection upon your institution, but rather one that reflects the difficulties of college applications. As I have been rejected from several institutions, I had to make the difficult choice to reject one of my rejections. I hope you understand.


Sincerely,


u/LRFE

I just got accepted to my first school, University of Arizona!! I feels so amazing to know that no matter what happens in the next six months, I‚Äôm going to continue my education somewhere.

On top of that, it‚Äôs a school that I can afford, which is a big deal for me and my family.

To anyone out there who is stressed about the upcoming application season, consider applying to a school with rolling admission, it really makes a huge difference.

I know Yale is slightly higher ranked(120 spots means nothing though because there‚Äôs over 3000 colleges in the US) but if I go there I wouldn‚Äôt be able to brag about getting into an ivy league. If I go to ASU I‚Äôll get to wear my Yale sweater and tell everyone within a 100 mile radius that I got accepted even though I tried kissing the interviewer, and most of all feel superior over my fucking useless classmates.

Thoughts? I already have my 1600 SAT score(out of 2400 though) on my Instagram bio so my flex game is on point.

Dear Carnegie Mellon Admissions Committee,

Thank you for your interest in giving me a Carnegie Mellon rejection letter.

I have reviewed your letter and am impressed with your rejection reasons and other suggestions. However, I have received many rejection letters this year. Therefore, after careful consideration of your letter, I have decided not to accept your rejection letter.

Please understand that this is not a negative evaluation of your letter, but rather a reflection of my unique choice criteria.

Once again, I appreciate your courage to give me a rejection letter and wish you every success in your future rejecting.

I'll see you on campus in August.

Best wishes,
u/i_r0n_ic
Class of 2024 Applicant

## [PSA for high stats applicants - early admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/chmm33/psa_for_high_stats_applicants_early_admissions/)
I see you.  You're a brilliant kid, you're looking at top 10 at the lowest.  Harvard, Stanford, University of California Chicago (what, that's not what UC Hicago means?).  Your parents and teachers tell you that you're a shoe-in for these schools.

That doesn't matter.  You should be applying to a rolling admissions safety school RIGHT NOW.

You're doing what you are supposed to do.  You've chosen your SCEA school, your application will be in on time for that and for your backups.

But you're not going to find out until December if you're in to the SCEA school. And chances are you'll be deferred, so you have a long, long, long wait until the end of March to find out.

So do yourself a favor.  Spend part of that enormous brainpower and whizbang research skill and find a nice school with rolling admissions.  They exist.  Apply.  Many of them waive application fees.  Many of them will be so flattered that you've considered them that they'll throw money at you in an attempt to get you to attend.

A rolling admissions school could have an offer to you before school starts.  Often they give out scholarship money in a first come first served basis.  So, applying early means you get more money.

Imagine walking in to school in September, all your friends are nervous about applying.  And you're there, still nervous, but you have a solid backup plan.  "Well sure, I'm hoping for Princeton, but if things go sour I have that full ride from Temple to fall back on".

If you get deferred from your first choice (statistically likely) then next February will be the longest month of your life, and every day in March will feel like it lasts a week at least. You have so many stresses in your life.  Getting your safety school locked down early relieves a bunch of stresses that you did not know you were feeling.

Do it.

## [A2C Calendar Cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cppz05/a2c_calendar_cycle/)
**January**: "How much do mid-year reports matter?" "Can I still apply to this school?" "When can I send test scores?" "if I use a VPN will I have extra time to submit my app?????"

**February**: "Ugh this wait is killing me" "I'm dying of senioritis." Many panic posts about if someone has already been rejected because they haven't gotten interview offer. Equally panicked posts about some people getting likely letters. Top meme season, as many of us are bored. "ANY LAST MINUTE ADVICE FOR INTERVIEWS??".

**March**: "Any news on this schools decision date?" Shit load of results threads from every T20 and "I got into this school!" posts. Juniors starting to ask about schedules. Should I update colleges one week before decisions come out?

**April**: Questions about waitlists (z-list?????) Also posts of this college vs that college. Questions about putting down 2 enrollment deposits. Depression and existential crisis part 2. Humble brags.

**May**: Many last minute questions about schools on May 1st. Posts about getting off waitlists. "Will I get rescinded for 2 B's?" "Got into Harvard AMA!"

**June**: Happy or sad senior posts about leaving high school (depends on the person). "Thank you A2C for everything you've done for me" posts. Juniors begin to outnumber seniors.

**July**: New crop of seniors asking about colleges are probably doing many visits. Every post is tagged with "rising senior".

**August**: Seniors starting school. "I'm so mediocre" pessimist posts begin and early birds complain about essays. Resource compilation posts are upvoted/stickied. "I only earn 250k, in that sad lower middle class zone, how will I ever go to college?"

**September**: College freshmen will make AMA posts, even though they are still in the honeymoon phase at their new school, like they've experienced it all. "What are subject tests?" "do I need subject tests?" "Is a 790 Subject test good?" "Does recommended mean required?" "Does required mean required?"

**October**: Over achievers submit early applications. First acceptances from rolling state school. Everyone is so hype to see that stuff and then it gets triggering when you haven't gotten into a school yet. Lots of essay questions. And no, your love for hentai is not appropriate for your UChicago essay.

**November**: Questions about ED/EA deadlines. The inevitable question about if someone can apply to 2 ED schools. "Should I submit my 35 ACT or 1590 SAT?"

**December**: Lot of heartbreak after ED rejections. Let's get cracking on the RD essays. People rant about how shitty their winter break will be. "10 essays and 3 days fml". "Does 11:59 mean 11:59 EST or what? Is there a grace period? does January 1st mean December 31st 11:59 PM or January 1st 11:59 PM?" Depression and existential crisis part 1.

## [TRULY UNPOPULAR OPINION : Online APs are a Necessary Evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmdryc/truly_unpopular_opinion_online_aps_are_a/)
On this sub, it appears the general sentiment is that College Board is some giant scam that purposely created an unfair online test-taking experience. While some of this is true (I certainly disagree with College Board's status as a monopoly and supposed "non-profit"), there are certain parts that I think are just completely false. Here are some of my points...

**1. THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER TO THE CURRENT TESTING SITUATION**

While I understand it is frustrating, I believe it is important to think about the predicament that College Board is in. They must create a standardized test that all universities can trust as a method to gauge course understanding, as well as assuring that this test is accessible and achievable for the average student. As well as this, they must try to maintain the authenticity and security of these results when they are being taken AT HOME. Given all of this information, what all could they really do? If they had decided to import the ENTIRE test online (multiples essays, short answers, multiple choice), students would complain about the difficulty and there would likely be even more technical difficulties due to people's internet cutting out across such a long time span. If they had made a longer test and more relaxed time requirements, it would give students even more ability to cheat and share answers, further compromising the security of the test. While imperfect, I think the current format for test-taking is about as good as they could have gotten it. My only real gripe is that I wish the personalized email option had been open to the first week test takers, but I suppose hind-sight is 20/20. Regardless, I would like to hear if anyone on this sub has a better alternative to the current testing format, genuinely.

**2. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO CANCEL ALL THE TESTS**

Another common sentiment I see on this sub is that tests should have been cancelled right out of the gate. This is simply an immature thought in my opinion. If they had done this, I have no doubt that people on this subreddit would have been livid given the fact that they had just been robbed of the opportunity to gain college credit. I know personally, a large number of my friends are counting on their current APs to exempt them from a number of their college classes. While the current testing format is imperfect, I appreciate that given all of this craziness, we are still given the ability to further our education. Additionally, If you truly believe this testing situation is too unfair, College Board is accepting all refunds so you don't have to take them if you don't want to (I understand some schools require you to take the test as a final/mandatory curriculum. I do think this is unfair)

**3. THE REPORTS WE HEAR ARE LARGELY EFFECTED BY BIAS**

I am extremely empathetic of those who experienced technical difficulties when submitting their APs, but it is important to realize that the reports we hear are largely inflated by selection bias. Those who have technical difficulties are more likely to voice their concerns than those who did not. This effect is often called the "vocal minority." Again, while unfortunate, it appears that no test in week one had a failure-to-submit rate of more than 8%. That is still a sizable number and should be considered, but is definitely not the amount that is being portrayed by this sub. It should also be said that those who experienced errors (at least in my class) commonly did not take the required submit time (5 minutes) and instead gambled by attempting to submit with 2 or less minutes left. While this is obviously unfortunate as well, it should be understood that at least some of the submits errors were user-based issues

**CONCLUSION**

It needs to be said that the current situation we are in is difficult. We are taking a test that is different from what we have prepared the entire year for and it is completely fair to be upset. However, painting College Board as this purposely malicious entity is simply not true. I believe there are improvements that could be made on the current system (The retest window should happen RIGHT after week 2, there should have been more stress-testing done on the current website, email option should have been standard, greater accessibility to test taking options), but I also think that the current iteration we have is pretty okay and not as bad as everyone is displaying it as. Regardless, I would love to hear your opinions on the situation.

## [My advice to rising seniors](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cfby8k/my_advice_to_rising_seniors/)
After being on this sub for a while, I'm finally deciding to leave it, seeing as how I'll be off to college in a month and I want to stop comparing how I did in high school to everyone else on here. Before I go, however, I want to leave some advice to all of you who are going to be applying for colleges soon before.

1. Start your applications early. Don't procrastinate on them. That just makes for a lot of stress.

2. Get your letter of recommendation early and MAKE SURE YOUR TEACHERS SUBMIT THEM TO THE COMMONAPP OR WHATEVER YOU'RE APPLYING ON. Nothing sucks more than knowing that your teacher wrote a great letter of recommendation for you, but they never submitted it. That happened to me while I was applying and I kept forgetting to talk to them.

3. Apply early to a school with rolling admission that you like, even if it's not your first choice. If you can get an acceptance early-on, then it will help calm down your stress as the year goes on. That way, if you dont get accepted to your top choice(s), you'll still have a school like you like that you can go to.

4. When deciding on a college, make sure you know what the dorms are like. Sometimes, the campus is great, but the dorms are awful. You're most likely going to be living in those for one to four years, so make sure you'd be comfortable.

5. JUST BECAUSE YOU GET MAIL FROM A SCHOOL DOES NOT GUARENTEE ACCEPTANCE. For example, I got mail from a lot of places, but out of the ones I applied to, I was accepted to a total of two schools (I'm not going to lie, though, I was aiming high).

6. Just because your scores are above average for some places does not mean you'll get in.

7. Just because you are a legacy amd worked hard does not mean you'll get in.

8. Be proud of the schools that you get into, no matter how high the acceptance rate is.

9. APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS. ESPECIALLY OF YOU ARE IN THAT MIDDLE CLASS ZONE WHERE YOU CAN'T REALLY PAY FOR IT BUT YOU DON'T GET FEDERAL AID. Those scholarships can make a HUGE difference. Sit down and start applying. Stop procrastinating on that.

10. Pick a college because YOU like it and YOU want to go there. Don't let your parents, friends, teachers, or anyone else pick it for you. No matter how excited they are about it, you're going to be the one living there for 4 years. Even if it's some very prestigious university, if you're not happy there, what's the point? If you're going to be miserable all the time and hate what you're doing, what's the point in going there? Don't let anyone pick your school for you. After all, it's YOUR school.

11. Know that your rejections don't set your value as a person. Chances are, you're going to get some rejections and some acceptances. That's normal. Acceptances and rejections don't reflect who you are or your value as a person.

Now, I'm quickly going to say the obligatory "I'm on mobile" so that if the formatting is messed up, y'all know why. I hope that this helps you as you start the application process. Even if only 5 of you see this and take the time to read it, if it helps, then I'll consider it a success. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and good luck with your applications and college searches! May the odds be ever in your favor.

Apparently, some guy who wasn't going to Duke found his way into the group chat and lied about having BONE CANCER. The dude really sold it too, he had been VERY active in the chat for 2-3 weeks before dropping his "news" and changed his insta bio too. All of this was just to get sympathy from girls, and he also tried getting some of us to buy and send him merch and raise money for him for "surgery". We have a student intern from the admissions (or some other thing through the school) department in the group chat (shoutout babu) who got his hands on an admitted students directory and he exposed him to everyone and now the group chat is in shambles. So be skeptical of the group chats. Also, be suspicious if a dude named Lawerence joins your chats.

## [this sub in a nutshell](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/enxbcc/this_sub_in_a_nutshell/)
* **"unpopular opinion:"**
* "Having \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ means..."
   * High Test score, High GPA:
      *  " try hard"
      *  "no social life"
   * Sub-par test score, sub-par GPA
      * "go to community college"
      * "go through \[an extremely competitive, cut-throat\] transfer process"
   * Sub-Par test score, high GPA:
      * "cheating on tests and homework"
      * "easy classes"
      * "probably live in a potato farm in Idaho" (inflation)
      * "no social life"
   * High test score, low GPA
      * "payed >1k for prep books and classes"
      * "no social life"
* "This sub is toxic" -- posts that provide great observations, but add to the somewhat pessimistic tone in the subreddit
* "y'all need to get a social life"

The biggest concern I have for the sub is the fact people seem to be evaluating others' social lives based on their GPA and SAT/ACT score. In real life, would you really quantify someone's people skills based on academic numbers? Would you say out loud: "Wow, a 4.0 GPA? Do you ever get out of the house?"

Second, there seems to be a huge dispute between GPA or SAT/ACT score. I too, am biased when it comes to disputing whether test scores or GPA is a better measure of academic potential (stronger GPA than test scores). Yet, they're both going to be evaluated, and people shouldn't be discredited for having a strong GPA or strong test score.

I really hope this didn't hurt/offend anyone. I'm truly grateful this subreddit exists and have gotten great advice from you guys.

## [Unrealistic expectations really got me](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eauhdw/unrealistic_expectations_really_got_me/)
Today I was deferred from MIT and Caltech and when I found out the news I was doing great with it. Even though I had really wanted to attend one of those two schools, I recognized that as long as I put my best effort into creating the application that authentically reflects who I am, decisions are out of my control.  I say I *was* doing fine since other people‚Äôs reactions were what really upset me.

The problem for applicants who get rejected from top schools, in my mind, is that the people who know them think their acceptance is a forgone conclusion. As someone with high test scores, national/international awards, good grades, everyone around me seems to think I‚Äôm the perfect student. This creates a toxic attitude, particularly within my South Asian family. My mom literally told me today ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking this hard because I‚Äôm not accustomed to your failure.‚Äù Even a friend texted me ‚ÄúHave you heard the good news yet?‚Äù

I‚Äôm accustomed to my own failure: losing critical debate rounds, having months of research amount to nothing, etc., which should have made this easier. But when everyone around me is fixated on my perfection, it feels horrible to let them down. I know their expectations that highly competitive schools are (in the words of another friend) ‚Äúa slam dunk‚Äù for me are unrealistic, but not meeting these expectations that everyone seems to have is crushing.

Two pieces of advice that I think we all could use. 1) Students who didn‚Äôt get into their dream school want support, not consolation. They don‚Äôt want to hear about how good they were or how they should have gotten in. That only makes it worse. 2) Don‚Äôt create unrealistic expectations for your peers. College apps are more competitive now than ever, so even if you think you‚Äôre complimenting someone by assuming they‚Äôll get into their reach school, you‚Äôre just creating an even more toxic environment.

Tl;dr: Not getting in sucks even worse when everyone unrealistically assumed you would. No one is perfect, so don‚Äôt treat anyone like they are.

I am international so it was a skype call. he said we will talk about 45 min but it was 30min. It felt like he just wanted to get over it. I was expecting it to be a nice conversation but nothing near that. I read about other interviews and how the person was nice and friendly. He was so cold and apathetic like he didn't care what was happening.
asked me why i applied. what are my academic achievements. a recent challenge. outside school. he then asked me to ask questions. i asked 3 and then i couldnt say anything and he was like yeah nice to meet you bye.
honestly fuck everyone who wrote "see it as a conversation with a friend" and "they are to help you" and "they know how you feel".
i feel like i will cry all week.

edit: i apologize for the fuck everyone... this were my thoughts at a moment when a lot was going though my mind. i was disappointed of myself and i wanted to find somebody to blame. Sorry guys.

edit2: thanks everybody for the support, for sharing different reasons why my experience was such and for not saying maybe you suck. i appreciate it.

## [From a low income, URM, and first generation senior, the true reason for inequality in college applications is not standardized tests, but extra curriculars.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/daxxwc/from_a_low_income_urm_and_first_generation_senior/)
I understand that many studies show that those considered disadvantaged are going to score lower in the SAT/ACT than others, but that is a reflection of a larger inequality inside the U.S. Not only will their test scores be lower, but also their grades, volunteer hours, activities, etc.

Getting a good SAT score 95% of the time requires heavy studying. My first PSAT score junior year without any studying was a 1260, then a 1370 on the April 2019 SAT. It was above average for sure, but no where near where I wanted.

Now here, people can claim that someone richer than me has access to test prep programs, tutors, Barron's books, etc. It's true that I was unable to use these resources when studying. I didn't need them though. Today, there is plenty of free resources that can be just as effective. If someone wants a past SAT QAS, 90% of the time you can find it free online. If someone wants to study reading and writing, Khan Academy is actually a really good resource. The only money I spent for studying was Uworld, which for $50 for two months, gave me the tools for an opportunity for a perfect 800 on math(Even if I would end up not getting that). In my viewpoint, better to spend $50 now with my own money from work than be burdened with thousands in loans.

If you don't already know, if you have free lunch or any other requirement, you can go to your counselor and get a fee waiver, which provides 2 SATs, 2 sittings for subject tests, and an unlimited amount of colleges you can send your SAT scores to.

Over the summer. I studied well enough to manage a 1500 on the SAT(750,750), even with one of the worst math curves. My financial woes didn't prevent me from getting a score I wanted.

Great. Now with a great score, and a decent GPA with 11 APs, based on academics alone I can compete for top schools.

But we all know academics is your ticket to the lottery, not your ticket in. There's still essays, recommendations, and extra curriculars. Two of these things don't depend on your finances. And this is where the true inequality arises.

A student's access to extra curriculars depends entirely on the socioeconomic status of their neighborhood and school. You won't find clubs dedicated to olympiads or volunteering at poor schools. Some sports may require a registration fee, and require the student to pay for their own equipment. Some sports might not even be available. While I do go to a good school that does have access to all these clubs/sports, sometimes the time needed to participate simply doesn't exists.

If you're poor, you know that family responsibilities make up a significant portion of your life. Whether it be work, or babysitting younger siblings for extended periods of time(sometimes even for whole days), there just isn't enough time during the school year to do what we're passionate about.

For me, it's the latter. In the summer, I would care for my 3 year old sister for around 8 hours a day, leaving me with just enough time to study for the SAT, and nothing else. Despite loving football, and even being in a position to start, I had to quit not because my parents forced me, but because I knew I couldn't give the time needed to be great or even good at the sport.

People rag on athletes for getting scholarships to top colleges with lacking qualifications, but at least someone will know they've worked hard for their goals. I know the only reason students get internships, or get to work alongside college professors, or somehow publish papers is because of connections. And they tell me this directly.

I care for my sister, providing food, education, and safety, yet if someone helps out at a soup kitchen, my hours are invalid, and theirs is viewed as "giving back to the community" and "selfless". So many students at my school school claim to volunteer often, but when pressured to say what they actually do, it winds up being essentially nothing but goofing around with friends, and they happen to be at a senior home. They don't help anyone, yet they are the good samaritans.

I know many people actually volunteer in good faith, and I commend your service. I also commend those who were able to follow their passions in biology, piano, basketball, or whatever they deem so. Just understand that not everyone gets the ability to even develop their passions. No, I can't just "get involved". I and many others have responsibilities that prevent us from such.

If anything, the main reason I want to go to college is to finally do the things everyone else does on high school.

Passions are supposed to be the staple of our applications, instead of a seed that has yet to sprout. But for many students from low income households like myself, that is our situation.

## [The ONE KEY DIFFERENCE between my students who did and did not get into T20 Schools](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fvmlfa/the_one_key_difference_between_my_students_who/)
I had nine students apply to T20 schools this year. Four of them didn‚Äôt quite have the raw numbers or ECs to hang, so I‚Äôd like to talk about the five that did. Of those five, three got in and two didn‚Äôt.

Those two not getting in really bugged me. Those students were excellent and would have crushed any school in America. They‚Äôre both attending solid UCs so their lives aren‚Äôt over. But they didn‚Äôt get into the school they deserved to. What went wrong?

I scanned over all five students' applications looking for discrepancies. I came across a difference that I think was key for why the yesses were yesses. The good news is that difference is repeatable by every student on here willing to put the effort in.

Wanna hear what it is?

The students who were rejected wrote about their interest in their major and plans to utilize it ‚Äúonce they grew up‚Äù. The kids who got in wrote about how they were already utilizing their major and planned to keep doing so at college. It‚Äôs a small difference, but one that drastically changes the way an AO sees your profile.

Put another way, Resume>Passion. You be the officer:

Student A is applying chemical engineering because he wants to work in a lab. Chemistry is his favorite class, and he dreams of building model viruses to test antibodies on. He watches Youtube videos on the topic constantly.

Student B is also applying to chemical engineering. He knows he likes it because he spent the past two summers interning at a local lab that builds the exact models student A talked about. There, he learned a ton about advanced concepts no one at his school understands. He‚Äôs excited to start a protein folding club at school to introduce other smart people into this world.

Everything else is the same. Who gets in?

College applications aren‚Äôt that different from job applications, and the best way to qualify for a job is to have already done it. Companies want someone who will show up and be productive from day one. It‚Äôs only when that person doesn‚Äôt exist will they go with an enthusiastic newbie they have to train.

College want the same deal. They want you to already be a professional in your topic. The schooling is incidental. That same four-year robotist is going to show up day one able to join and support the school‚Äôs robot team. That‚Äôs the kind of edge you need in this elite game.

Of the three students of mine who did get in, one was a EE major with four years in robotics. One was a Stat analysis major who had built a movie stats app by herself. And one was a music major who plays in the city orchestra. The two nos lacked that proof of their interests and dedication. They just had a lot of passion and a lot of promises about the future.

So that‚Äôs where you come in. Quick, what‚Äôs you‚Äôre declared major gonna be? Don‚Äôt know? Pick one! If you can‚Äôt, pick a major you‚Äôre willing to tolerate for now. Next, take up an EC that directly links to that major. I can give recommendations to those that ask, but my best advice is to do research and ask your favorite teacher in the subject for help. You can be blunt about it,

‚ÄúHey. I plan to apply as a bio major in two years and I want to have proof I can do it. Do you have any ideas of any competitions or events related to the topic I can do?‚Äù

He may then forward you to a weekly Saturday excursion where people dig up clams from the beach and dissect them for research...of something. Congrats. You do that now.

What you pick to do can be creative, but it must involve you utilizing your future major in a productive way to create something objective. Those results can be a product, research, a paper, a win in a competition, or something else.

Robotics is the easiest version. If you‚Äôre applying to engineering school, go sign up for the robot team. Now.

For other topics, you may have to look outside school. Don‚Äôt be afraid to leave your comfort zone. Any activity that places you in contact with real-life professional adults is excellent. Let them teach you, so your future school knows they don‚Äôt have to.

Also, hi! I‚Äôll be posting blogs like these now and again. I work as a private college counselor in the Bay Area and am currently working on going private. I‚Äôll have a website soon! Let me know if you enjoyed this post. I have a lot more ideas I‚Äôd like to share.

We all fuck up in interviews.

I personally have a few moments that occasionally keep me up at night. Not just from college interviews ‚Äì I'm a bungling buffoon during internship interviews, debate tournaments, and class presentations. I figure, though, that I can't be alone. Haven't we all experienced that one cringeworthy moment, that instance of instantaneous embarrassment we so zealously yearn to retract? If you answer "no," you're probably just not self-aware.

As such, I asked four of my friends about their interviews. Each of them are bright, talented, and entirely worthy applicants for their schools, but each can be a stumbling bastion of bumbling ineptitude at a moment's glance. Unsurprisingly, then, we all fucked up during our interviews. I rank them below in order of ascending stupidity.
_______________________________

**#4: Mixing up the Colleges**

This guy's first choice was Duke, with Middlebury being a rather close second. These are, as y'all know, two very different schools with respect to location, athletics, and (especially) size. He had conducted due research on both, and emphasized components of each college which appealed to him. For Duke, he loved the large class size. For Middlebury, he loved the small class size.

The doofus forgot which college he was interviewing for.

It went a little something like this ‚Äì

**Doofus:** "Middlebury's large size deeply resonates with me. I enjoy having several opportunities available to me on campus, and socializing with new people each day. I think it'll be integral to my college experience, and Middlebury offers just that."

**Interviewer:** "Middlebury, uh, Midd's class size is about 2,500‚Äì"

**Doofus:** "Exactly. But the breadth of opportunities available at Middlebury ‚Äì their clubs, intramural and varsity sports, teacher-student interactions ‚Äì makes it feel big. There's an opportunity for each student, the ability to explore several directions, hence why I say 'large size.'"

Honestly a remarkable save, in my opinion. He remarked that the interviewer bought it too, as they began talking about which clubs interested him. He got deferred from Duke ED and is waiting on Middlebury RD.

**#3 Just a Terrible Answer**

Interviewing for Vanderbilt. She said her interview was going smoothly enough, nothing remarkable but hardly any mistakes. Their conversation was winding down and she was handling the stereotypical exit questions, principally "what do you look forward to doing the most at Vanderbilt?"

What would you answer? Probably something safe like engaging in Vandy's education training program, relaxing in the library, seeing the first snowfall, etc. Not her, though, for she is a nincompoop.

**Interviewer:** What do you look forward to the most at Vanderbilt?

**Nincompoop:** Attending one of the frat parties, putting myself out there... Vanderbilt's party scene is a major selling point.

**Interviewer:** Oh ‚Äì‚Äì I was looking for something academic, but that's a unique answer.

Not too bad, but certainly not the ideal way to end an interview. She got accepted into Vanderbilt, though, so I guess something clicked.

**#2 Really Weird Wording**

This friend has a particular penchant for writing. He's able to string words together eloquently and impactfully, in a way where he invokes emotion. Sometimes, though, he misuses words or inadvertently creates really fuckin' weird pictures, as he did during his Dartmouth interview.

He said it was going pretty well, they were conversing about teacher-student relationships and the importance of accessible professors. We all attend a pretty small and progressive school, and routinely consult our instructors outside of class. So this lummox says:

**Lummox:** Maintaining relationships with my instructors is just indispensable for college. I feel Dartmouth has that. At [high school]... we have deeply intimate relationships that extend beyond teacher and student.

**Interviewer, thinking:** *this guy's gonna fuck every professor at Dartmouth*

Rejected from Dartmouth ED. Guess the fertility rate in New Hampshire's high enough already.

**#1 Insulting your Fucking Interviewer**

Williams College up in Massachusetts has a pretty good XC program, believe it or not. This friend is "the guy" on our cross-country and track team, and he was interviewing with some Williams alumni. They got to talking about the athletics program at Williams, namely the success that their XC team had this year (they made nationals, I believe).

I should add that his interviewer was a rather large woman.

Everything was going smoothly, he says, until this dunce whips out this gem:

**Dunce:** Running's a major part of my day-to-day life. Practice starts at 4:00, and it usually takes two hours between running, stretching, and weight training. But I love it ‚Äì the competition, the drive to better yourself ‚Äì it's just something I need to continue in college.

**Interviewer:** That's refreshing to hear, having a passion and sticking to it. I personally don't run‚Äì

**Dunce, smiling cordially:** Yeah, I can tell

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:**

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:** I am so, so sorry

The conversation continued awkwardly thereafter, and neither side brought it up again. I asked him just what the fuck he was thinking, and he had nothing.

He did not get into Williams.

## [[Opinion] The SAT is the most fair part of admissions besides LOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gonsvr/opinion_the_sat_is_the_most_fair_part_of/)
So as soon as the UCs decided to phase out the SAT I saw a lot of posts pop up complaining about how GPA or ECs are more unfair than taking a standardized test.

In today's era there are so many free resources you can take advantage of, I've seen people recommend Khan Academy over all other forms of test prep. The CB also offer fee waivers to low income families for the SAT.

A lot of people who mention SAT tutors seem to forget that actual tutors are a thing as well. Beyond that, while a grade is able to be changed months after a class was taken, an SAT score is tamper proof.

Also, while SAT or ACT testing centers are held pretty much everywhere, the same can't be said for great ECs. Many are dependant on location, connections, or being able to pay for the expensive activities. It's hard to win a national competition if you can't afford to attend.

Even LORs benefit wealthy students. Many of my first gen friends didn't know about their importance until they started on the common app, so they were unable to lay the groundwork with a teacher in the spring.

Overall, the college admissions system is heavily in favor of the wealthy, so it feels odd to vilify the test that you could walk in and ace in one shot, instead of the activities that require constant deposits of both time and money that low income students just don't have.

## [I WANNA BE A WILDCATü•∫](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fle5rm/i_wanna_be_a_wildcat/)
Hi everyone,
It‚Äôs my first time posting but because Northwestern is supposedly coming out tomorrow, I just wanted to put my thoughts down. Northwestern is my absolute dream school, and I‚Äôm so so nervous after already getting rejected from another T20. Haven‚Äôt really wanted to tell a lot of people close to me about everything because of so many reasons lol.

I decided to make this thread for all those also worried about Northwestern and more specifically to ask that we support each other whether we receive acceptances or rejections!! UPVOTE FOR THAT THICK ACCEPTANCE THOUGHüò´üíú See y‚Äôall tomorrow, hoping for the best!


EDIT : They confirmed on their Instagram that decisions will be out Tuesday, March 24.

EDIT: I got rejected, but I wish y‚Äôall the best <3

## [Should I update my waitlist schools with these new circumstances?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gh2fab/should_i_update_my_waitlist_schools_with_these/)
So, I have severe life circumstances going on that I never mentioned in my application for any of my schools that I have been waitlisted at.

I was waitlisted at Cornell and Emory (both oxford and emory).

So, I almost died these past few weeks. My former step-father grabbed a gun and shot through our window a few times (he has extreme PTSD and is a former veteran so he gets insanely crazy sometimes). He talks his way out of things and hides his evidence. The reason he's mad is because we have custody of his son (which is my step brother, we have the same mother but diff dads) and he's been trying to do anything to get custody of him, which is why he tried to kill us. Today, Sunday May 10th, my mom is getting arrested (in a few hours when the police are scheduled to come) because of some issues I don't know. This will make me homeless as we're already a very low-income house hold.

Do you think I should mention this in my application? I'm just trying to make sure they have a clear understanding of what is going on in my life right now. I haven't told them anything other than that I live in a single-parent house hold. I've avoided saying this because I didn't want to make a sob story, but I don't know if I should mention this now.

Hey everyone, just wanted to start with saying thanks for giving us a read. ‚ù§Ô∏è

It‚Äôs been a really horrible time for me: my entire family including me is currently sick with corona and on top of everything I got rejected by my top TWELVE schools. (Just got my last rejection! I can now proudly say I was rejected by 13 colleges)

I am clever, and special, and kind. I am worthy. I know that. It‚Äôs just really hard to remember right now.

What set me off wasn‚Äôt not being accepted to an IVY, because I really don‚Äôt care about that now. It was being waitlisted at Vassar, my dream school.

I really am not a fan of my Safeties because they just don‚Äôt fit me as a person and I really don‚Äôt want to move states. I only applied in case I didn‚Äôt get into other schools, which evidently happened.

I just feel so worthless and sad. I worked so hard during high school and struggled so much due to my severe dyslexia. But I‚Äôm ultimately so proud of how I did. I just wasn‚Äôt right for my schools.

Mostly looking for support and positive outlooks. All my safeties are great schools, I know. Please be kind, I‚Äôm very beaten down right now.

If you‚Äôre curious about stats I do have a chance me post from a while ago but I‚Äôll sum up the basics here:

(as Inigo from the princess bride says, ‚ÄúLet me explain... No, there is too much. Let me sum up.‚Äù)

I am a Greek girl who moved to America in Sophomore year. My passions are mountain climbing, martial arts, plant collecting, rowing, reading, and the outdoors.  I love school, trying new things, and people. Education means a lot to me so I‚Äôm thankful to at least be in college.

This is mostly a rant/ conversation post to help me come to terms with not getting into Vassar. Please feel free to share your stories too. I know rejection is hard but we‚Äôll get through it.

Update:
Thanks so much for all the kind responses. You all really are the best. I would personally respond to everyone but there are quite a few so instead I‚Äôll do this. If you commented I just want to say:
Thank you. It really means a lot to me. You made me smile and hope again, which is something I‚Äôve missed these few days.

People will say that your essays are the most important. Your extracurriculars. Your SAT. Wrong. I hope this will serve as a wake up call for someone, because people constantly think that they can make up their low GPA with other stuff. I am class of 2019, and I had everything great except my GPA. I had a very high SAT and subject tests, great ECs, and was told my essays were amazing. I put a lot of effort into all these things, yet I got rejected from 15/17 of the colleges I applied to. In fact, if it wasn‚Äôt from a stroke of luck, I would not be going to the great school that I‚Äôm going to today. I know many people from my same school that had worse test scores, essays, and extracurriculars than me, yet got accepted into the same schools that I did not get into. Please, if you are a junior, focus on your grades. If you‚Äôre a senior, you still have time to grind and get a good 1st semester grade. Admissions are so competitive that a low GPA might rule you out regardless of everything else. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes I did.

## [A message to future international STEM applicants, particularly Asian students](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fr4hru/a_message_to_future_international_stem_applicants/)
Admittedly, I'm using a throwaway account.

I'm currently an international freshman student at a certain college in America. I wanted to share some (unasked-for) insight for future international applicants who are interested in STEM.

First, my stats. I want to emphasize that I have no intention to brag about my accomplishments, so please don't take this the wrong way.

(To keep my anonymity, most stats are kept vague but are written so that the gist is understandable)

I am an Asian male looking to major in a certain field in engineering.

GPA:  4.0/4.0 (Constantly in the top two throughout all my years of high school, which is one of the top three high schools in my country. We need to pass multiple tests to enter our high school.)

SAT: 1560/1600, first try (not that that means anything)

SAT 2: 800/800, 800/800, first try (Math 2 and a certain science subject test)

Extracurricular activities *(Most are kept vague to preserve my anonymity):*

* Invented/Discovered a certain new thing under the mentoring of a university professor, published paper and accepted to present at an international conference
* Won national competition in a certain field. The twist was that other than me every other participant was a  college student pursuing their masters degree in the field
* Captain of a high school team competing for a certain well-known international contest
* Won in multiple national contests related to my field
* Started multiple clubs at my school, and every club has won a national award of some sort
* Recognized and was provided full-ride scholarship grant by my country for the four years of my college (excuse my passive voice)
* etc.

Most professors in my country who are in my field of interest knew who I was from my research and I've been interviewed for a news article too-which isn't an extracurricular, but I want to emphasize that my application can probably be considered to stand at a very high level.

Essays:

In my senior year, I've written 1216 essays (This includes short 100 word essays all the way up to the common app). I know; it sounds like BS, but it's true.

International students *WORK THEIR ASSES OFF.* I remember living on an hour of sleep and spending a constant five to six hours every day writing and rewriting essays for a whole year. I had everybody I knew (including a relative who has experience with college applications/essays) and consultant professionals check my essays.

After a grueling 1216 essays I was confident that my final products were the best I could produce. My common app way my revision number 83. I did everything I could, paying attention to each and every word in every essay, and admittedly submitted my application at 11:58 P.M. All my essays were perfectly at the word limit, which doesn't mean jack sh\*t but yeah.

Some parts I could've improved were my SATs and my submission time; I definitely could've spent more time grinding out practice tests to aim for a 1600, and while it's said to not have an effect on college decisions my submission time was probably a bit too close to the deadline.

Again, I'm not here to brag.

And now my results.

Out of the 21 schools I applied to, I was accepted to three and wait-listed/rejected by the rest. Yes, I applied to Ivy league and so-called "T20" schools. I got into one Ivy league school (No, not HYP) and two other very awesome STEM-focused schools who were kind enough to give me a smile of acceptance.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here's my message to the fellow future STEM international applicants.

* The whole admissions process is "unfair" and biased in countless ways. Why? I'll explain in the following bullet points. But I guess that's just how life is.
* Asian + Male + STEM, especially CS, ME, or AE = You're going to have a very hard time.Yes, being female will increase your chances of getting into a better school; this is very clear from admission stats. I'm not trying to undermine the accomplishments of the accepted female students and saying that they've achieved less than their male counterparts; I'm saying that with the same/similar level of stats, most colleges will probably choose the female applicant. I'm also implying that yes, the "each and every person is special!" is BS.
* Contrary to popular belief, yield protection does exist.
* This is probably well-known already, but international students need to achieve WAY higher than the average student in America to obtain similar results, i.e., "We consider each application without regards to race and ethnicity" is obviously BS.If this was actually true, American colleges would be flooded with international students, particularly from China and India, but in that case, where would domestic students go?In other words, the international applicants from competitive backgrounds are most likely VERY, VERY smart. One person I know who goes to MIT is a math genius; not just the "typical international math Olympics gold medalist," I'm talking Von Neumann-level of genius. Dude literally solved the hardest problem on the math Olympiad in under 15 seconds.That's the competition you're (or rather, us international students are/were) going up against. And one thing that tends to go unseen is that it's VERY, VERY difficult to even do an extracurricular in most Asian countries, whereas in America opportunities are abundant and handed out to students who want to participate in them.Colleges need to have "diversity" in their student body; they can't just admit every qualified international applicant (Which, in my opinion, is fair. Every country has colleges international students can go to, and American colleges are technically for American students in the first place). Your race/ethnicity/family income are all (uncontrollable) factors in your college application. Even if you're super good at what you do, if there are tons of others with the same conditions then you'll have a less chance of getting in compared to somebody who has "achieved less" but has unique uncontrollable characteristics. Accomplishment itself is a very relative factor.This is one reason why you shouldn't feel disappointed in yourself when you don't get accepted to a certain school; you were qualified-perhaps even more qualified than a portion of the admitted students-but you were waitlisted/rejected because of something you can't control. At my school, I hate to admit that around 70% of the people here aren't the shiny, omnipotent Ivy league students people think they are.
* As a STEM student, you aren't only judged by how smart you are. As in, you can't just be good at the technical stuff, unless you're so good that you're number one in the world and nothing else matters, even your grades and SAT. You must create an image of yourself where you're also good at things like PRing and the humanities, your "compassion and care for others" in your application in some way. I believe this holds true for the future, when we apply for jobs/positions too.This does go against the traditional  "follow your true passions" BS, but like explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), most applicants are doing their extracurriculars for the application, not their passion.
* This follows from the previous point, but if you want to get into a good school you are most likely better off pursuing something that sounds good on an application than your true passions.This is the reality.In my case, I was lucky enough to have my real passions work out for me at the end. I've continued my research in college, and things are working out quite well. But chances are most people won't be as lucky as I was.Sadly, you just can't write about your hobby of gardening unless you've obtained a really prestigious award which shows your "artistic skills."
* The vast majority of students from international countries who are applying as a STEM student and were accepted to HYPSM have an Olympic Medal or something close to that.No well-known international/national awards? You only have a slim chance of getting into T20s, and even if you do have a prestigious award, you still may not get in. In my case, everybody around me was shocked to learn that I didn't get into HYP. Again, I'm not trying to boast.
* Essays are very important for domestic students, not international students. Of course, there are outliers but in general your extracurriculars are what get you into T20 schools. But if you are willing to bet on that sliver of a chance where you're going to be that outlier, you're most likely in for a big disappointment. I'm not saying to give up and not try;  I'm saying to not aim too high and expect to prove reality wrong. Unless you're Einstein, it's probably not going to happen.

My point is, to all the Asian international male students who are looking to major in a field of engineering: I'm sorry, but most of you won't get into your top choices, especially if your top choices are Ivy League-level colleges if your extracurriculars aren't at a godly level. The chances of a Chinese or Indian student getting into an Ivy League school are just too low and too competitive.

From my personal experience and what I've heard from others, this is the harsh truth.

EDIT: This post is by any means not to discourage future applicants. However, such applicants should keep in mind the competition you're up against and expect the worst from your best results.

## [Two Yale Grads‚Äô Honest Advice about Admissions Essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/doj4nw/two_yale_grads_honest_advice_about_admissions/)
Guys,

We posted this over the weekend and it got buried, but I'm posting again in the hopes that you see it.  We made this video for this subreddit after reading all your posts about how stressed you are about essays, and I think it's got some really helpful advice. We graduated from Yale over 10 years ago, and John has served as an interviewer for Yale for many years. We have full time jobs now, but really enjoy mentoring young people this time of year and have reviewed 1000s of student essays. We took some time to think about where things go right, and where things go wrong. We really hope that this video and summary serves you as you go into the final push here.

Here's a summary of the top pitfalls to avoid and things to think about as you work through your essays:

1. Avoid writing an en essay which doesn't say anything specific about YOU, and just recounts your experiences.

2. Avoid essays that are overly descriptive and lack introspection. You don't want a long description of XYZ activity or experience - you want a brief description of what happened, and a DEEP dive into how it changed you.

3. Don't waste too much time trying to come up with flowery/descriptive language and stressing over word choice. Essays can be well written, and still not convey any actual information. Colleges care less about perfectly crafted vocabulary choices, and more about compelling stories.

4. Don't focus on another person's actions - a story about your friend, teacher, etc, is not helpful for an application about YOU.

5. The big litmus test you should ask yourself for each essay is: "Is this an essay that ONLY I could write?" Anyone could write an essay about something that HAPPENED to you, but only you can explain how things shaped you internally.

6. Focusing too much on the topic is not a good use of your time. Your essay doesn't need to be about something inherently extraordinary, you can choose a very ordinary thing that excites YOU, and that passion will come through.

7. Don't try to present your entire life and accomplishments through a rose colored Instagram filter. If you have had difficult and hard things happen to you, you MUST talk about them. Colleges are interested in people with grit, and in people who have experienced hardship. Don't gloss over the difficult things that you have overcome. Your struggle is an important part of who you are.

8. Discuss what happened, and also discuss how it impacted you in the moment and how it impacts your future plans and what it makes you want to study at XYZ school.

9. Present a consistent narrative about who you are as a human being. You shouldn't write a long essay about how wonderful your experience was on the JV soccer team if you never played soccer again after one semester.

10. Remember that your essay is going to be read by somebody who doesn't know you at all and who has limited time to focus on your application - they are not going to read over it 6 times to discern what you're trying to say. It needs to be crystal clear.

11. If you have the chance to write more than one essay or just one, always choose to do the maximum possible.

12. Take advantage of any opportunity to discuss something "weird" or "different" about you - even if you are embarrassed about.

13. Make sure that other people review your essay - as many people as you can, and try to choose the most well educated people in your network. Just because your guidance counselor says it's very good, does not mean it's great. Your guidance counselor probably went to an "okay" but not great school - try to find people who went to the schools that you are interested in going to, and get THEM to review the essay. (Note: we do provide essay review services, you can message us for more info).

14. Keep in mind, everything is going to be okay. This is the hardest time in your young adult life, but it will all be over soon, and you will be just fine. Where you go to school is not the be all end all of your life, and you will be just fine.

Here‚Äôs a link to the video, we hope it serves you:

## [For anyone that might need to hear this...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cuz68r/for_anyone_that_might_need_to_hear_this/)
Let's get this out of the way, yes this is a throwaway.

I'm making this post for anyone that might be where I was, and who might need to hear this.

I graduated High School in 2007.I had summer school plenty of times. I almost failed High School. I did however have a near perfect SAT score... back when it was three parts.I struggled in school, and went to a community college because I was told that was my only choice.I failed out of that too. For a year I went with a sub 1.2 GPA because I paid out of pocket with a fund my parents set up when I was young.Neither of my parents went to college. My dad never finished high school. I never had anyone teach me how to study, how to prepare for really anything school related.

I worked in a warehouse, and then did basic tech support.I witnessed my cousin killed when I was 15.I struggled with depression for a long time and sought help when I was 26.I was unhappy with my job because I couldn't seem to move up.I tried to kill myself.

I moved back home at 27 and talked to a therapist again. I did that for over two years. Late 20s, living back at home. Yep, it sucked.

At 30 they said I was okay to stop my antidepressants. They did however diagnose me with ADHD at the end, and prescribed me with Adderall.

At 29 I met a really wonderful woman and started a relationship, she's supported me in ways I had never felt before. I decided to try school again.

I managed a 4.0 the first semester back at the community college.A 3.6 the second. (Statistics man, the final killed my 4.0)A 4.0 the third. Calculus ain't shit with hard work.

Today, at 30 years old I was accepted into my number one choice for Electrical Engineering.Three days after applying.

My mom cried when I sent her the email.My dad texted me back and said "Lol."

Sometimes things in life take longer to figure out, sometimes they don't work out when everyone says they are supposed to. Sometimes there are also things in your life impacting who you are, how you act and they take time to recognize. Then you grow past them. You will.

I didn't get into an ivy league school. It's not super prestigious. I had 115 credits at a community college. My GPA barely moved with a 4.0 in 13 credits - that's how bad it was.

But I got into the school that was a stretch due to my GPA for a degree that's tough after being told by so many people that I won't, can't, etc.

You will too. You'll figure it out. You're going to be just fine. Even if it takes a little bit longer. Your hard work will pay off. It is worth it.

## [To everyone who applied ED to the same school as me...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dqi2tq/to_everyone_who_applied_ed_to_the_same_school_as/)
Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart: I hope you get in.

College admissions has turned into such a cutthroat affair. And I get it, to some extent, because I can understand the near desperation of wanting to attend your dream school. But I don't want this whole process to turn us into enemies. We're in this together.

We've all come this far. We all DESERVE to get in. I know that everyone's situation is different. We have different test scores and GPAs, different ECs, different financial situations; some of us have struggled quietly with mental illness and burnout while others have faced tough living situations and environments. Yet what unites us is that we've all done the same thing: worked our absolute hardest to get where we are now, to finish our applications, and to send them in.

A lot of us will get rejected. But it's not because any one of us is better or worse than the other-- we all have our stories to tell, our scars to show, and stats alone can't possibly define us. It's just how it is with a competitive school!

I'm prepared to not get in. I know I'd be happy at any of the other schools I've applied to. But I'm hoping and dreaming, and I'm doing the same for every single one of you!

So in this time of stress and waiting, and the waiting joy and tears at the end of the line, know that I'm proud of all of us. We've gotten this far! And we'll continue to go far, no matter where we go. But let's hope it's to our dream school.

Love you all! We got this.

(Edited for typos, like all our apps hopefully!)
(Edit2 to add: I'm also rooting for everyone applying to other schools, of course ;D)

## [On all the "philosophical" admissions negativity...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dtml35/on_all_the_philosophical_admissions_negativity/)
The admissions process isn't fun. That's just a fact. But lately I've been seeing all these posts on A2C criticizing the process in a philosophical/"deep" way. I just wanted to address the trend. To the people who have been writing these: you're great writers, and I'm sure you'll go far in college and beyond. This isn't supposed to be a call-out post for you. I'm just trying to make the process a little better for everyone.
The admissions process might not be everyone's favorite thing (it sure isn't mine). Everyone has one part they hate more than the rest. For me, it's essays. I just can't seem to write them in the right way. For other people, it might be standardized testing, or ECs, or just schoolwork in general.

But here's the thing: **If you want to go to college, you have to apply.** There's no school that's going to magically show up at your door and offer you admission. If you want to go to college, you're in the application process right now. (If you haven't started your apps yet, close this window and open the common app.) If you're reading this, you probably want to go to college. So you have to apply. Yay! What does that mean? Cue the dramatic A2C posts...

*I've wasted the past 4 years working on homework and schoolwork in hard classes!*
*I've spent time doing things I don't even care about just to look like a "good student"*
*I had to take this super pointless test a bunch of times and waste my time and money!*
*And now colleges want me to reduce myself into 600 words!!!*

I used to say stuff like that too, until I realized three key things:

1. If you hate the process, you're doing it wrong.
You don't have to love the College Board, or enjoy taking the SAT. But if you hate your extracurriculars, you probably picked the wrong ones. If you hate spending time in class, now you know what subjects you shouldn't major in. If you absolutely hate writing your essay, change the topic! You're not trapped in the things you do. You haven't "wasted your time". You've gotten one step closer to college, and learned things you'll need to know in the future - even if it's just what you don't want to study. So when you go off to college, you'll be better prepared for it. And who knows, maybe you even had some fun along the way. You know, just a little. :)

2. It's really not that deep.
Colleges aren't reducing you to 600 words or a 4 digit number, as much as it might feel like it. The essay isn't asking you to condense yourself into 600 words. Honestly, you're already in the application. Your ECs, transcript, recommendations, accomplishments, and maybe interview all tell enough of a story. The essay isn't forcing you to fit yourself in a text box. It's giving you the opportunity to put your own voice in the application, and just talk to the admissions officers.
In the same way, the numbers aren't everything either. Colleges look at your SAT and GPA (but not really GPA, more the transcript) to make sure you're academically prepared. But for most schools, the stats don't make the decision. They're just one way you can show you're ready and you've accomplished a lot. That can also come through in your ECs and recommendations. Don't stress about the numbers. You're so much more, and colleges know it.

3. (the most important one) Complaining doesn't get anything done.
I'm not saying you can't complain. Complaining is fine, and honestly it's healthy. But don't get yourself so worked up about the process as being "horrible" and "unfair" that you lose all motivation to work on your apps. I've been there. My friends used to go on and on about how awful the process was, and it made me lose some of my motivation to get them done. If you're positive about the process, you'll have so much more motivation, and writing those apps becomes so much easier. Just try it out for a couple days. You'll see the difference.

So just remember: The process isn't all that bad. It is what it is, and if you want to get to college, you have to make the most of it. Even though it's perfectly fine to complain, don't worry too much about how "awful" it is - just focus on how great your applications are going to be! :)

now go work on your apps lol

I (straight) decided to room with a gay guy because he seemed pretty cool. He told me that he has a boyfriend which made me figure out he‚Äôs gay (I had a little hint before tbh because of his pics) and it didn‚Äôt even matter to me and as soon as he knew I didn‚Äôt have any problems with it we mutually decided to room together. So I was facetiming my friends and told them about finding a roommate. So one of them just asked his name and started stalking his insta and figured out he‚Äôs gay and started making fun of me. Like how can you live with someone who is attracted to you? And like then they started making gay jokes on me. I was like ffs he‚Äôs just another guy and it‚Äôs 2020 I thought we were over this medieval mindset.

## [a message to those applying to college right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d1hmal/a_message_to_those_applying_to_college_right_now/)
hey, seniors. i know it‚Äôs a really stressful time of the year and it feels like your entire life depends on how to gift wrap all the hard work you did the past several years..

i was in your shoes a year ago. damn, i depended my life on college admissions and applications. it‚Äôs all i talked about, it‚Äôs all my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù talked about, it‚Äôs all my parents talked about.

as if it‚Äôs life or death. terminologies like t20, t10, legacy, scores, ranking, fafsa,..all of it stressed the shit out of me.

it felt like if i don‚Äôt get into a certain level of a school then i‚Äôm pretty much fucked for life or something, you know? like if i don‚Äôt get into a t10 i‚Äôll think, fuck, i could‚Äôve been this or that and now i‚Äôll never get that chance. just because i missed 30 points on the sat and didn‚Äôt get this score, just because i didn‚Äôt stay up the extra couple hours to study for the ap exams.

but honestly, although i‚Äôm only a freshman at uni now, i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. it definitely is not.

&#x200B;

your school and the value is what you make of it. sure, the label of a prestigious school can help. but what‚Äôs more important is the experience and the quality of it.

and once you go to the school you choose, you won‚Äôt think back and hate yourself for not studying harder for the sat‚Äôs or ap‚Äôs or revising your essays more. you‚Äôll be so caught up in the moment trying to make most of what you have in front of you and as long as you make it really worth it for you, it‚Äôll be worth so much more than being accepted into some ivy or a goal school of yours.

because from now you are focusing on what‚Äôs ahead of you and what you have now. and by all means, try your hardest to get into the school that you want to go to. don‚Äôt hold yourself back. what i‚Äôm trying to say is, don‚Äôt stress so much about what you could miss out on. focus on what you got. don‚Äôt look at what other‚Äôs have because everyone will deal with what they have differently. focus on you, what you want, and what you can do with what you have.

don‚Äôt beat yourself up for not being ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù because there is no such thing. you are. you are all unique and have your strengths and ambitions and no school is ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or the ‚Äúbest‚Äù for anything.

&#x200B;

i‚Äôm a bit of a hypocrite and sometimes i think about how i could‚Äôve gotten in somewhere better but honestly that has not helped me. being upset about it. instead, i'm getting involved on campus and building myself up so i can create myself. i don't have to make this school define me but i can create experiences of my own. i think that's what's most important.

&#x200B;

good luck to you all. and don't forget you all have done an incredible job getting to this point. give yourself some credit and don't be so hard on yourselves. whatever happens, you will be fine. you'll be happy.

love you all!!

## [A Dream Come True](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpw1fc/a_dream_come_true/)
I applied to 6 ivies besides Cornell and Dartmouth.
I‚Äôm a runner and literally I ran twice yesterday because I couldn‚Äôt stop being nervous for the decisions. I got accepted into Brown and will be the first in my family to go to college. It literally felt like I ran a marathon cause I was so out of breathe when I got in. On top of such great news, my parents were so proud of me. Yet, what finally caused me to crack and cry was the financial aid. They basically gave me a full ride and I couldn‚Äôt stop hugging my family knowing I don‚Äôt have to worry that they‚Äôll be paying for college. Life was always tough going bill to bill, waking up at 4:30am to go to work on weekends, being so independent because my parents couldn‚Äôt help due to the language barrier. I never expected to get this far, in fact if you asked me 5 years ago I wouldn‚Äôt have expected to be going to a college in the first place. I have one more decision and I can get straight up rejected cause I‚Äôm on top of the world right now.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your congrats and positive comments it means a lot. Congrats to everyone on A2C as well wherever the journey may take you.

EDIT: Got into my last school which was Stanford. I‚Äôm literally in shock.

Imagine:
It's 2019. You're a high school senior applying to colleges. You're 17, maybe 18. You're a kid. Your frontal cortex is underdeveloped.

You take a Test that measures how well you take tests. You don't like your score, you take it again and again. Finally, you have mastered the skill. This massively sought for, heavily rewarded skill - must be crucial to survival right? You come to find later in life you never used it again.

You sum up your entire existence into 600 words. You delete a hundred of those words to not make it too tedious to read.

"Tell us why you dare think you're worthy." You did your best. You wait patiently to see if you were chosen to put yourself in debt and pay thousands of dollars for a stressful experience.

(I'm just cynical about it today)

If they ask you a difficult question and you think you're going to stutter out a dumb response, just say something to the effect of "I'll have to think about that for a second", then wait the 15 or so seconds that it takes you to collect your thoughts, then answer. Don't just start spewing words unconfidently that you'll regret later. Interviewers understand that applicants don't always have the perfect response straight away, and it'll actually reflect well on you if you tell them that you're giving your response some thought instead of making word salad.

We all try so hard here for that 1600, 4.0, EC, Jobs, etc for college and many of us won't make it where we want. We'll go to a state school like everyone else who didn't try, we'd have everything we did for nothing. I feel like if I get rejected from my ED and inevitable from any T20, I've accomplished nothing. My time has been wasted and I would have been in the same school if I had done nothing.

The Outcomes of High School by Alex Isaac

Want to know something funny?
Were students.
We're 15-18 year olds.
We're supposed to be young.
We do our homework.
We study for tests.
We memorize answers.
We take all honors.
We memorize formulas.
We take eight APs- like its normal.
We play three sports.
We're in four clubs
We're in NHS.
We take SAT prep courses.
We compete against each other.
We apply to Ivy Leagues.
-- --
We're tired.
We're exhausted.
We're anxious.
It's been four years.
It's been long nights.
It's been no sleep at all.
It's been panic attacks.
It's been ADD pills.
It's been a disappointment.
We've memorized every answer.
We've learned every answer.
We've applied to every college.
It paid off, right?
-- --
But...
Ask us how we're doing...
Ask us if we're okay...
Ask us ABOUT ourselves...
And we'll freeze.
We don't know.
Because there wasn't an answer.
There wasn't a formula.
We didn't learn this.
It's not in our textbooks.
Not in our notes.
Not on the SAT.
All that prep work.
All those r√©sum√© builders.
All those sleepless nights.
All of it.
It didn't work.
It didn't mean anything.
We didn't learn how to think.
We only learned how to memorize.
If
We're losing our minds,
If
Knowing the answer is more valuable than learning the lesson,
If
Our "education" is clouding our personalities,
Then
Our diplomas are more important than our sanity.
Isn't that funny?

## [Juniors: Bored At Home? Here‚Äôs What You Can Do](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmsh86/juniors_bored_at_home_heres_what_you_can_do/)
So, maybe quarantine‚Äôs getting you down. Maybe you‚Äôre like me, and haven‚Äôt done homework in weeks (would not recommend, even for a senior). In any case, you‚Äôre definitely on A2C and probably looking for something to do. Here are some ideas.


&nbsp;


**Start planning for your letters of recommendation.**

Figure out who you‚Äôre going to ask, and start preparing all the materials. I have a whole post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gm1jbc/letters_of_recommendation_101/) that dives into much more detail on what you should be working on.


&nbsp;


**Start narrowing down your college list.**

This is pretty important. I thought I had picked out a good list, and then changed my mind about applying to a lot of colleges, and **then** I thought I had figured it out by the time I had submitted my apps. After submitting, I realized I didn‚Äôt want to go to some of the schools I applied to, whether it was fit, financial aid, or strength in my major.


Here are some quick tips on choosing what colleges to apply to:

* If you need financial aid, apply to colleges with generous financial aid. Most T20s and top LACs offer the most generous financial aid. Run each college‚Äôs NPC (Net Price Calculator) to determine how much you would get. These are generally extremely accurate unless you have a weird source of income or other extenuating circumstances.

* Side note: also **consider colleges with generous merit scholarships**. u/ScholarGrade has a very thorough list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/). Keep in mind that these are extremely competitive. You need higher stats than even those who get into T20s. (Usually, those who get these are those who get into HYPSM etc., the merit sways them and gets them to attend these schools instead).

* **Consider fit over shotgunning.** Some colleges have very different cultures than others. For example, Duke, Vandy, and Dartmouth are all T20s that are very fratty, and on the other end of the spectrum, you have schools like MIT, UChicago, and Caltech which are more known for their course rigor and difficulty (others would call it stress culture).

* **Find schools that are strong in your department of interest.** Some schools are known for certain things, others are excellent for everything (cough cough Stanford). For example, Georgetown SFS is hands-down the best program for international relations, UPenn Wharton is the best for business, etc. Georgia Tech is great for engineering, Purdue & UIUC are great for CS.

* Yes, put that college that is ‚Äúout of reach‚Äù on your list. Even if you don‚Äôt get in, you aren‚Äôt left wondering what could‚Äôve happened.


&nbsp;


**Start drafting essays.**

I know it‚Äôs early, but the work you put in now means that work that you won‚Äôt be suffering over essay writing during Christmas or New Year‚Äôs. Keep in mind that Common App wipes/resets every August, so you shouldn‚Äôt start filling in anything in Common App yet. Most schools‚Äô supplements stay the same or change very slightly each year, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about your effort going to waste. Even if they do change the essays, you can probably use the already written essay for another school, and you‚Äôve gained experience writing essays.

Speaking from personal experience, I found that it took much longer than anticipated to brainstorm essay topics, write them, and then edit them until I was satisfied. And despite the fact that my essays were not great in the summer, it gave me a good foundation to approach more supps in the fall as well as a crude draft of some supplements to refine.


&nbsp;


**Start studying for standardized testing.**

I‚Äôd say drop the SAT IIs (unless your schools require them), most schools don‚Äôt care much about them and many other schools are dropping the requirement/the option to even submit SAT IIs (hello MIT & Caltech, trying to lower your acceptance rate?). r/SAT & r/ACT are great places to find advice or other free resources. My guess is that less emphasis will be placed on test scores, but it‚Äôs still important: colleges still have to pad their median SAT & ACT scores.


&nbsp;


**Start working on a personal project.**

This isn‚Äôt as daunting as it sounds. Find something you‚Äôre legitimately interested in, and pursue it, even if it‚Äôs for an hour a day. I imagine you guys have a lot of free time. Personally, I‚Äôve been improving my cooking & baking (free time = lots of breadmaking), working out a lot, exploring my town through biking, and a little bit of Python coding. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù you say, ‚Äúbut that doesn‚Äôt even sound like an EC to me.‚Äù Wrong: I literally put cooking as one of my ECs (I spent a decent amount of time on it last year), and was able to talk about it in a meaningful way. Plus, it‚Äôs an extremely valuable life skill.

Working out may not be an EC in of itself, but you can certainly make it into one. I founded a fitness club at my school to coach other kids, and talked about that as an EC. ‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt do that now.‚Äù Obviously not, but I actually saw a reddit post on A2C asking if anyone wanted to get in shape and keep each other accountable. I asked OP if they wanted to make a groupme, and now we‚Äôre at 80+ members and counting. I‚Äôve also helped set up a google classroom to keep group members accountable and to help coach others. That, combined with working out, can definitely be counted as an EC. (If any of y'all want the link, please chat/PM me).


&nbsp;


**Or, look for other interesting things to pursue.**

It doesn‚Äôt have to be a project, but there are certainly things you can be doing. One of my friends was doing shopping with InstaCart (relatively safe, the only risk is when you go shopping, the delivery is contactless) and making $20/hr. A job is always an EC. Speaking from personal experience, part-time or entry level jobs are also looking for workers now.

Or maybe there‚Äôs something else you‚Äôre interested in. Maybe that‚Äôs reading (if that‚Äôs fanfiction, I don‚Äôt judge and AOs will never know if you just list reading as an coronavirus activity), or writing, or drawing, or painting, or woodworking, or learning a language, or anything else you can think of. The best thing to be doing is learning **something** that you‚Äôre interested in. COVID-19 has given us a gift in the form of a shitton of free time to take a breath and slow down.


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**: make a college list, get LORs, start your essays, pursue your interests.

## ["Just go to your dream school for grad school!" is so freaking dumb (10 reasons)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g5h4oi/just_go_to_your_dream_school_for_grad_school_is/)
If I hear that one more time I might scream.

1. Not everyone's dream school is a university. As a LAC   girl, many people have dream schools such as Swarthmore that don't have graduate schools.

2. Not everyone is planning to go to grad school. Not everyone is planning to go to grad school. Not everyone is planning to go to grad school. Even on a sub full of overachievers, not everyone is planning to go to grad school.

3. Grad school admissions aren't that simple. Although fairly straightforward when compared to undergrad, just because someone goes to an "easier" college doesn't mean they will have a good GPA/GRE/experience when time to apply comes.

4. What a student wants may change. Many people's opinion on schools is shaped by undergrad culture and experience. When looking at grad programs, they might not find what they want at their dream undergrad school. After 4 years of life, they may want to be in a different part of the country or a different environment than what they wanted before.

5. It reinforces the notion that if you go to a "bad" college for undergrad, it's fine as long as you go to a "good" school for grad school. In reality, you'll be fine if you go to a less selective school for undergrad regardless of where (or if) you go to grad school.

6.  It simultaneously reaffirms that the affected person has the skills to get into the school for grad school and disavows their disappointment in not getting in for undergrad as they can "just go there for grad school."

7. Rather than promoting healing and moving on, it promotes fixtation on a particular school. Moving on is an important skill to learn and students should be moving into their college with different goals (I want to go to school X vs I want a successful career in this field) than their senior selves.

8. It doesn't encourage the student to flourish at their school for the sake of flourishing, it encourages it for the sake of achieving a "goal" of their dream school. Perhaps this is the remnants of "the life of the mind" in me, but I think undergrad should be for the sake of learning and experience rather than for the sake of getting into a particular school.

9. People who say it are just trying to be nice ü•∫. No one is trying to be mean when they say "Just go there for grad school" they're just trying to convince the person not to give up hope or feel lesser about themselves. To tell them that their dream is still a possibility. This bothers me so much! It's one of those simple seeming phrases with a ton of underlying messages üò¨ that gets repeated through generations.

10. It just makes me mad üò§

Not sure how well this is going to be received but here it goes anyway -

So basically I probably won‚Äôt be able to go to any of my dream colleges because of cost, even with scholarships. I do not qualify for any grants, but my parents will 100% struggle to pay for my college, let alone my two brothers in a few years. It is kind of BS that it is just assumed that just because we are middle class we can pay for college. Most of my dream colleges are about $25,000/year, that is about a quarter of my parents income. My friends have the same problem as well, they are gonna have to deny their dream schools simply because they cannot afford them and don‚Äôt qualify for any grants. Super annoying.

They act like they try to give people hope but really end up discouraging people even more. Only make those videos if your stats are ACTUALLY not perfect. Then, your videos would help people.

## [A compilation of complaints against Mr. Admeeted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gbko78/a_compilation_of_complaints_against_mr_admeeted/)
**EDIT**: Mr. Admeeted responds to allegations [here.](https://imgur.com/a/YNoKxEW)


I first heard of Mr. Admeeted through a few reddit group chats. Multiple people were complaining about how he would not stop talking about his app, Admeeted in admitted student groupchats. Then, someone posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g0gtzx/you_shouldnt_be_allowed_to_join_admitted_students/?amp%253Bamp%253Bamp%253Butm_medium=ios_app&amp%253Bamp%253Bamp%253Butm_name=iossmf) which provided a lot of information on why people dislike him. Even after nicely asked to leave from some groupchats (and being forcibly kicked from others), **he would not stop.** [Here‚Äôs some evidence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g0gtzx/you_shouldnt_be_allowed_to_join_admitted_students/fnbtre9/) He also claimed that he was staying in these groupchats because he was deciding between schools and weighing financial aid. However, Harvard provides very generous financial aid, and furthermore, he had already commited by April 9th according to [this instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-xNICTBL9H/). What‚Äôs more, he is a Coca Cola Scholar according to their website [here.](https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/blog/our-2020-coke-scholars/) **It seems that Dalbert is inconsistent and unreliable, at least so far**.

While the spam is annoying, it‚Äôs understandable that he wants to promote his product. The reason I am making this post is because multiple people have come forward and accused him of firing his cofounders/coders and taking all the credit for creating this site. The entire thread can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/) The post has been removed but you can still view comments.


Here are some select comments from that thread in order to understand the situation a little better:

[Links to articles published by Harvard/Princeton about admeeted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp3j2e6/)




**Summary of what‚Äôs going on so far**: this guy creates an app with help , spams multiple group chats to try his app, then allegedly kicks out his co-creators, and gets people at Harvard/Princeton to write about and promote his app.


&nbsp;


As best as I can, I will try to refute some of the claims that he has made below.

[In this comment,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp46qzz/) Mr. Admeeted says this: ‚ÄúFirst, Admeeted has never made any revenue: there is no profiteering here. 1) Everything has always been free. 2) There are no ads.‚Äù. Yet, not does he claim that he has attracted venture capital attention [here,](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-coronavirus-visitas-admeeted/) but Admeeted is registered as a for profit company (see censored screenshot [here](https://coinsh.red/ipfs/QmZjaJs85N88RzfoZtUDpBVQnXxS2ARNgaBJnhj15ZA2Ve?filename=yeeted-admeeted.png)). To elaborate, venture capitalists would only be interested if Admeeted is or will be profitable, which goes against what he claims: ‚Äúno profiteering here‚Äù.


Mr. Admeeted also claims that (in the same comment) that ‚Äúthis has never been on my LinkedIn resume, nor any resume for that matter. I just want to help people‚Äù. Like I mentioned, this company is is registered as a for profit, not for helping people, and he has already talked to venture capital investors. Strictly speaking, while it is technically not on his Linked resume, he created a post on Linkedin about his ‚Äústartup‚Äù and looking for people to hire [here.](https://ibb.co/pZyxY8S). He is also hiring on the Harvard careers website (same description). See [here](https://imgur.com/s4SaWMQ) and [here.](https://imgur.com/RuF8wmr)


The next part of his comment addresses the dispute in removal of some people who helped him create Admeeted. According to him, ‚Äúthere was initially a team of volunteers that wanted to help me with my project - however, due to family emergencies and other reasons it became difficult to work with a group, so before any major contributions were made I thanked them for their support and they all agreed amiably to leave. There was not even a website at that point. I absolutely give credit where it is due, but in this case, the final product and website bear no contributions by those initial volunteers.‚Äù (Comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp46qzz/)). I‚Äôll address the allegations in a bit, but I just find it hilarious that he copied/pasted this exact message in defense of himself in a GroupMe [here](https://imgur.com/a/wf5NX8l). Guess you have to stay pretty consistent with your lies if you don‚Äôt wanna get caught. With regards to his claim, a person who worked on it (comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp453pw/) says that they were removed without really agreeing to it. Furthermore, while not illegal, it seems wrong that these people who helped set up the website get no recognition or pay while Dalbert is hiring people and paying them (picture [here](https://ibb.co/pZyxY8S)).


Another developer came forward and provided a similar perspective [here](https://imgur.com/L0aOnnc). It seems that the ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù team put in significant work (contrary to what Dalbert claims) and that he plans to put ads on it, despite his claim that Admeeted is not for profit.


Here is [yet another developer perspective](https://imgur.com/a/vNeTfHQ).


&nbsp;


Just as a side note, he had a google form on his instagram asking for anyone who wanted to promote his app. Basically, the form asked them to copy/paste a message asking people to join Admeeted, since he is probably banned from most admitted student chats. The form is gone now, so you‚Äôll just have to take my word for it. Here's a screenshot that someone managed to grab: https://imgur.com/gallery/JRmz9Yo


There is some other suspicious stuff going on as well. In the two threads that have been created, there have been some fishy accounts popping up. While some of the comments have been deleted, and others removed (for sensitive information) check out these accounts that were all created the day of the first post. u/admeeted has denied that any of these accounts are him, but no one knows for sure.


u/ln456. Defending the creator of Admeeted, but definitely deleted some other comments that were probably more blatantly defending him (seeing as he‚Äôs at -8 karma and he only has two comments at 0 upvotes).


u/Atleasthesnotavirgin. Again, defending him, with some choice language. No posts or comments since then. He has two more removed comments insulting other people on the same post.


u/zainali02. Older account, but hopped in the thread to defend Dalbert. Has no posts/comments on A2C before that. And one really weird comment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp41t4v/)


u/karenthethrowaway/. Another throwaway account created the day of the first thread. Only activity is the old thread (3 comments, 2 of which are removed) and then another post linking to the newer thread.


That being said, there are some a lot of all bashing Dalbert in this thread, so who really knows what‚Äôs going on. Here are a few: u/fuckalbie123, u/throwaway_ploopy, u/throwaway92838381, u/titi0808. It seems that most of these are throwaway accounts. Perhaps they are involved with Dalbert or know someone who did. To me, the whole thread is suspicious--there are a lot of people on both sides attacking and defending the person with equal vigor.


&nbsp;


Lastly, there is some really suspicious stuff going on with r/admeeted. It was created by u/Saholy, but they are no longer even a mod. The only moderator is u/SubjectBend, who has some strange comments like [this.](https://www.removeddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1eyd/remember_the_harvard_guy_advertising_his_website/fp44td4/) (I had to use removeddit since they deleted the comment). It seems like they‚Äôre trying to drive traffic towards r/admeeted, for whatever reason. I talked with them, and while it is not Dalbert, they admitted that they know him personally and that Dalbert wanted them to work on the Admeeted project. I have no clue what is going on here, but it just seems off to me.


&nbsp;


I have only presented the facts (or what appear to be the facts) so far. Dalbert has also been accused of trying to get people‚Äôs acceptances rescinded when they tried to remove him from their group chat or talked bad about Admeeted. If anyone can provide evidence of this, that would be great.


**I have also heard that a group of developers who had worked on the project are planning to compile evidence and come forward.** Here is a direct quote: ‚ÄúWe're planning to do a more formal release with hard receipts showing the work that we've done, as well as a combined testimonial from as many people as we can get in contact with, but we'd like to try and emphasize that we don't wish to spread any hate on him as a person or have him rescinded for his actions. We just want him to own up to his mistakes, give credit where it's due, and make sure that he doesn't continue to profit off of stolen work.‚Äù

&nbsp;


**In conclusion**: I have simply compiled all the evidence on Reddit and the contradictions between Albert‚Äôs claims and other people‚Äôs claims. I have no vested interest (I did not help with Admeeted) but wanted to make sure that everyone has all the information.

## [Serious question- do kids at your school cheat?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ejg6g4/serious_question_do_kids_at_your_school_cheat/)
I was curious because I recently found out a former friend of mine got into a T5, and they're the type of person who cheats to get a 100% in a class instead of a 96% (Even though they are both high As). They're very smart, albeit not very kind, they just happen to cheat a lot to keep a 4.0. They're just the type of person to sneak in the ACT math formulas, even though they are good at math, if that makes sense.

I honestly didn't even realize how big of a thing cheating was until AP World junior year, when people would whisper during the test for answers and get mad if you didn't reply. Students would also brag about how good they are at cheating.

Anyways, how much do people cheat at your guys' school? And how much do you think it affects their GPA?

## [The Greatest Case of Senioritis: throwing a surprise party to avoid a test](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fkjadj/the_greatest_case_of_senioritis_throwing_a/)
So my Spanish teacher scheduled a test on Friday that none of us were ready to take. We were *absolutely* all going to fail the test. I'm talking not-a-single-question-right failing. Now, we could have spent the night before studying diligently. But, with senioritis in full force, this was never going to happen.

Instead of studying, we all coordinated to throw a surprise party in class, hoping this would make our teacher forget about the assessment. The next day, we all walked in with cupcakes, bagels, cream cheese/ butter, donuts, cookies, and even drinks. We went back and forth:

"Why do you have food?"      "It's a party!"

"What are you celebrating?"   "My birthday was 2 weeks ago, St. Patrick's day is next week, Pi Day!"

"Why didn't I know about this?"   "We coincidentally all brought in food at the same time. That's crazy!"

Eventually, I jokingly said, "With this Coronavirus going around, we may never get to have a highschool class party *ever* again!" This is what won our teacher over in the end, and we had the party. That test? Never to be seen again.

Looking back, I realized something. It was a fun class period, but now our school is closed indefinitely because of COVED-19. There's a chance this truly was our last high school class party.

TLDR: Instead of studying, we planned a surprise party in Spanish class to make our teacher forget about the test that was scheduled.

So I know this is on Wednesday but it's not a shitpost- all true

I joined this subreddit because I was excited about going to college. And let me say, I was absolutely blown away by some of the posts on here

I literally had NO IDEA it was so competitive, nerve wracking, and just... hard to apply to college. ED, deferred, T20... I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt even know what a lot of those words meant lmao. I was so surprised.

I have... average stats I suppose. (3.6 gpa, about 7 ap classes, theatre as an extracurricular, 1110 sat score) I thought they were pretty good but after seeing all you guys I realize they aren‚Äôt lol. I visited one school, fell in love with it, and I only applied there. It isn‚Äôt a prestigious school, it‚Äôs got a high acceptance  rate. Heck, I didn‚Äôt even have to write an essay to get in. I found out I had made it in a few weeks later.

And I was so excited! I cried because I was so happy. I wanted to make a post here, but I was a little... I don‚Äôt know, embarrassed? You guys all work so hard, and I just... didn‚Äôt. I felt like it wouldn‚Äôt be received well.

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am VERY impressed by the work ethic some of you guys have. A lot of you have been working so hard for all of high school to get into a good college, and that‚Äôs something to be proud of!! I‚Äôm not saying my way is best, or that I‚Äôm better because I didn‚Äôt try as hard. That‚Äôs not true at all!

  You guys are all so smart, and talented, and hardworking. And I am, too. I think it all boils down to how much we dream. You‚Äôve all got bigger aspirations than me, and that‚Äôs okay.

The sky‚Äôs the limit for some of you guys, but me?

I think I‚Äôm happy right here on the ground :)

## [Thoughts from a prestige-obsessed freshman, and what made me realize none of this matters](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f1wzro/thoughts_from_a_prestigeobsessed_freshman_and/)
Hey everyone, random throwaway here. As a current freshman, A2C helped me a lot last year, especially the posts from then-freshmen sharing their stories, so I figured I would return the favor and share my side of the college proces. I feel like a lot of you guys on this sub have the same prestige-focused mindset I had last year, and I want to let you guys in on a different perspective.


I'm just going to preface this word-vomit with my stats:

1520, 3.8 at a (tier 2) NE prep school, 4.0 first semester in college


My ECs:

Math Team Captain, MUN head delegate with state awards, and president of a microfinancing club. The only part of my application that actually mattered was the fact that I'm a dual citizen (US and a country in the middle east), I lived abroad for a couple of years, and I'm trilingual (with multiple national awards for one of my languages)


My story:

For as long as I can remember, my (first-gen) dad always pushed me to do more. It was a problem in elementary and middle school, but in high school, things really went to shit when his obsession with prestige bubbled up. Every August, like clockwork, he would make me apply to boarding school after boarding school. I spent three god damn years of my life on Exeter and Choate's waitlists (all of 9th, 10th, and 11th grade), and my dad still pushed me to apply as a potential PG last year. His obsession with the prestige of top boarding schools bled over to me, and the prestige (and the validation) became something I obsessed over.


Well, college apps were more of the same thing. He expected me to apply to Ivy's and top LACs, and would shit-talk my top choice because it was a small/niche program at an Ivy, and not a big name program that people would recognize (think Yale-NUS type of program).


Anyway, come Ivy Day, I didn't get in anywhere and I was devastated. I got into a few decent LACs, but after getting rejected from my top choice, I seriously considered taking a gap year.


After a while, I realized how big a mistake that would be, and decided on one of my match schools in DC (GW, Go Colonials!). I'm not going to bullshit you guys and say that it's been all sunshine and rainbows, and I have thought about transferring, but in a lot of ways, coming to DC has been the best decision of my life.

A lot of the people I've met in college are just as fake as people I knew in high school, but the nice thing about college is that literally no body cares. Once you're in the door, whether it's at Harvard or anywhere else, everyone is so focused on their own pursuits that there's no time for the petty bullshit I dealt with last year.


For me, what really cracked the rose colored glasses of prestige was realizing the opportunities mid tier schools can offer their top students. My best friend, who's now at Brown, had the highest GPA in the history of my school. Now, he's around the middle of the pack. I, on the other hand, was barely in the top 20%, but at GW I made Dean's list and get access to tons of special crap.


Because of my academic standing (which I wouldn't have at an Ivy), I get priority registration for tons of events (I got to see Nikki Haley, Ronan Farrow, and a few other really cool speakers last semester), and first dibs at internships and networking opportunities. Right now, I'm writing this post on my lunch break in one of the Congressional cafeterias, because I was able to snag a last-minute internship on the Hill 3 days/week. This is not the kind of thing I ever imagined would be possible this time last year, to me, getting rejected from Ivy's meant that I was doomed to a life of mediocrity, which I've realized is so absurd and overblown.


TLDR: Think you'll get rejected from an Ivy? Who cares, you'll just end up being a top student and kicking ass somewhere else

## [2020 APs are simply unfair](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/glpyt7/2020_aps_are_simply_unfair/)
Long rant below:

1. **Questions are not equal in difficulty:** The AP tests are not curved, and thus there is a preset number of points necessary for a certain score. That would be okay if the tests were like normal, but when there are tons of different prompts for tons of different students, how can you guarantee equal difficulty? Especially in a problem set with only two problems. How can you say one DBQ is objectively equal in difficulty to another? In my personal experience, the AP Physics 1 test seems to completely vary in difficulty. You have some problems that are straightforward fundamentals and others that are far more complicated. It seems completely unfair, and with the College Board not releasing much information on how different problems will be graded, it honestly makes some students who clearly received more difficult prompts feel left in the dark.
2. **A 45-minute test is not enough to test 1 year's worth of material**. When you have a test that is in a new environment, with the added stress of submitting your test in the given time, there is such a high chance of making one stupid mistake. When the tests are normal, one stupid mistake is okay because you have the rest of the test to compensate. But when you're tested with such a small number of questions, getting caught on a question/slipping up once or twice can drastically change your score. On top of that, so much is based simply on how lucky you get with your prompt. In all honesty, I am much better at physics than apush, but got a prompt on apush that I was very knowledgable about and got a prompt on physics that I was not as knowledgable about. With such a small test, there is simply just too much variance for it to be an accurate representation of one's knowledge.
3. **The College Board did not release enough materials in preparation**. The College Board really emphasized their platform, releasing tons of information on how it was going to work and how students should take the test. While this was helpful, it is important to note that some tests this year, notably maths and sciences, were drastically changed. All the College Board did to compensate for this change was to release 2 practice tests online on their YouTube channel, but these tests 1. seemed to be rough estimates of the actual test and not reflect the test much and 2. are simply not enough for students. The College Board consistently writes convoluted questions in efforts to make questions on simple concepts more difficult. When one has experience with these questions, they can get used to the format, but without much practice of the new format, the test felt almost completely blind.
4. **Foreign students** have to take the tests at ridiculous times. I don't know much about this as I live in America, but it seems that kids in foreign countries have to take the tests either ridiculously early or ridiculously late.

TL;DR Fuck the College Board

## [When AP Scores Matter and When They Don't (in My Experience as an Admissions Reader at Berkeley and UChicago)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c9vmfk/when_ap_scores_matter_and_when_they_dont_in_my/)
Hi all,

I've received a flurry of messages about AP scores, so I've awoken from the dead with a version of a post that I've posted in the past (with a few modifications). Hope this insight helps answer some questions about how your AP scores might factor into your college applications.

**Who am I?**

I was an Admissions Reader for UChicago, my alma mater, in 2012-2013. I was an Admissions Reader for Berkeley's dual business/engineering program, called Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology, in 2017-2018. Both programs' acceptance rates were in the single digits, so we were highly selective in evaluating applicants for admission. These experiences do not apply to all colleges; not only does my experience not represent universities with more generous acceptance rates, but differences exist between how highly selective institutions evaluate applicants. As a college admissions consultant, for instance, I just hired a former admissions reader at Stanford and Harvard to join my team and help me in counseling students on the application process. There are many similarities between our experiences but also some surprising differences in how our universities' evaluate applicants. Thus, I don‚Äôt speak for every university in the advice I give here today (or ever), as no one can.

However, I can say definitively that both UChicago (at least in 2012-2013) and Berkeley (in 2017-2018) considered AP scores in their admissions decisions.

I‚Äôm here to tell you how.

**How AP scores were evaluated at UChicago**

When I was an Admissions Reader for UChicago, the university had an alphanumeric ranking system (I presume they still have that same system, with higher hoops to jump over to get the highest ranking than when I read apps 6 years ago). Many universities assign numbers and/or letters to an application to rate their admissibility. I know Stanford, Harvard, Yale and Williams have similar processes. Berkeley‚Äôs general undergraduate pool uses check boxes, whereas the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program (for which I read) also assigns numbers to each application.

For UChicago, AP scores weren't formally included in our academic rating (which was determined by a student's SAT and/or ACT test scores, grades, rigor of courses, and class rank/percentile within school community). However, we also had a written section for additional context regarding a student's academic ability, and AP, IB, and SAT subject test scores were often taken into account within that section, if a student reported any scores. Good AP, IB, and/or SAT subject tests could help bolster a student's application if he/she/they were perhaps split between two possible scores (tipping the student into the better score designation). Bad AP, IB, or SAT subject scores, however, could raise flags about the student's preparation for certain subjects, especially if those low scores were in subjects related to the student's major. I don‚Äôt recall AP scores ever tanking a student‚Äôs academic rating, but we definitely used them to help assess the bigger picture of the student‚Äôs preparation for our institution.

**How AP scores were evaluated at Berkeley**

One of the first things Berkeley (and likely at least a few of the other UCs, but I cannot say for sure) sees in evaluating your application is the percent of applicants from your high school who have taken 3 or more AP exams. I definitely would not say that that percentage factored much into my own admissions decisions as a reader for the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, but we had that data and could, if we wanted to, compare the number of AP exams you took to students at your high school. We wouldn‚Äôt disadvantage an applicant who attended a high school which didn‚Äôt offer AP exams. After all, both UChicago and Berkeley (and other top universities) evaluate applicants within the context of the applicants‚Äô high schools and the resources those high schools provide (another factor we saw on the very first page of the application). So, if your high school doesn‚Äôt offer AP classes, don‚Äôt sweat it (though you might want to self-study for some exams; if you do well, you can report the scores and stand out from your peers, whereas if you don‚Äôt do well you don‚Äôt have to report your scores and no admissions officer is any the wiser).

**Berkeley took into consideration an applicant‚Äôs performance on AP exams, but the general admissions pool didn‚Äôt hold low scores against students.** So, in applying to Berkeley for, say, a history major, in my experience you don‚Äôt need to sweat your AP score of a 2, and definitely don‚Äôt sweat your 3s and 4s. However, for certain programs (College of Chemistry, College of Engineering, MET), lower scores could definitely influence an admissions decision. I want to be clear that I didn‚Äôt evaluate applicants from the Colleges of Chemistry or Engineering, so all I can go off of is what I learned in freshman reader training for the university as a whole (which discussed the policies for those two schools); in this training, I learned that strong scores in math and science AP exams were expected for top candidates to the College of Engineering, and strong scores in AP chem were expected for candidates to be competitive to the College of Chemistry. For the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, we were not only looking for strong scores in math and science APs but in AP subjects across the board.

**Some caveats**

Berkeley doesn‚Äôt disadvantage applicants whose high schools don‚Äôt offer AP, and admissions officers are generally understanding of applicants from under-resourced backgrounds who do not have the financial means to take or thrive in AP exams (if this applies to you, you might want to include that information in your additional information essay for context).

Also, **an applicant‚Äôs performance on AP exams was much less important in determining an admissions decision than other factors (their grades, rigor of courses taken, ACT or SAT scores, extracurricular involvement, and essays)**, as everyone knows what it is like to be overwhelmed by day after day of challenging exams. Besides, in many admissions officers‚Äô minds, there are better factors in assessing a student‚Äôs potential impact on campus than their performance on a single day of their life (which is why more and more schools are going test option, dropping the essay requirement for the SAT and ACT, etc.).

**What you should do if you have low scores**

A 4 is not low. Stop panicking.

If you *truly* have a low AP score and are applying to Berkeley‚Äôs College of Letters and Sciences, also try not to panic. I was just as shocked as you might be when I learned that they don‚Äôt count low AP scores against students‚Äîthey like to see that you tried.

If you‚Äôre applying to one of Berkeley‚Äôs specialized programs (Engineering, Chemistry, or MET) or to UChicago and other private colleges and universities with rigorous admissions standards, you still shouldn't panic. Focus on the aforementioned more important factors first and foremost (especially the things you can control in the months to come, like your essays). Even if the AP exam is related to your major, a good grade in the class, a strong letter of rec from the teacher (though don't waste a LOR *just* to compensate for a low AP score‚Äîgo with a teacher you love who loves you), demonstrated aptitude for/interest in the topic in your extracurricular exams, or a strong SAT subject test can absolutely help counterbalance an AO's concern for a low AP score.

If the AP exam for which you performed poorly is unrelated to your major, it has even less influence on your ultimate admissions decision. And, you don‚Äôt even have to report your scores; you can omit a score or two where you received a 2 or, if you scored poorly across the board, you can just choose not to send any AP scores at all. Sure, if you‚Äôre neck and neck with a single applicant and you reported no AP scores (despite having taken a few AP classes), or reported low scores, and they reported 5s on 12 AP exams‚Ä¶ you could be in some trouble, but colleges (again, only in my experience) rarely go to AP exams to make the tie breaker. They‚Äôre much more likely to turn back to your essays to assess your intellectual curiosity, character, or the value you‚Äôd add to their campus.

Again, you don't even have to report your AP exams. If you do, it's all self-reporting on the Common and UC Apps. I've never known a university to ask for an official report when evaluating applications... though, again, I haven't worked at every university. As such, check your universities' policies to know for sure whether you can self-report vs send an official report. Oh, and don't lie about your scores if you self-report!

**Questions?**

Ask away. I‚Äôm happy to help. I am on a trip at the moment, so I might be slow to respond to comments/in box messages. Sorry for the delay, but I will try to ultimately get to everyone!

Hi all!
I have been religiously following this subreddit. I just kind of wanted to share because I'm still in awe.

I got in to every school I applied to! Xavier, UMass Lowell, Mizzou (*with an automatic transfer scholarship), and IU East. Now I'm a 29F who graduated in 2008 and when I said "graduated" I mean by the skin of my teeth. I was a lazy high schooler who had to go to summer school, night school, and Saturday school just to walk across stage and get my diploma at a 0.97 GPA. I really just didn't think school was for me, even though I felt for the most part capable and intelligent. I had no drive.

After a few years of retail jobs that I was miserable at and seeing my fellow slacker crew graduating I began to feel a bit envious and enrolled in my local community college where I discovered a love for education I wish I had years ago. I somehow managed to get a 3.6 GPA and join the Honors Program and now I'm staring in disbelief as these acceptance letters come in.

I'm so grateful for online programs that are going to allow me to finally be a college graduate (alas, because of work Xavier is a no-go as it doesn't have a fully online degree program =[)

Anyway, I just wanted to let any other adult that thinks maybe it's too late or they can't work a full-time job and go to school that it's entirely possible. Also for any other slackers that every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.

Thanks guys for listening to my rambling! Now to choose, which is proving to be super difficult haha.

Hey guys. I'm in my 5th year and gonna graduate with an engineering degree in spring 2020.
My school has a 100% acceptance rate and it's awesome! I admit it may not be the best fit for everyone, but I like it because it it's super chill.

I'm doing an awesome internship right now, and my classmates are also doing great. They work at places like Microsoft, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, NASA, Space-X, ExxonMobil, and other top companies.

So don't fret so much about getting into a top tier university, you'd be surprised at how little your school matters in the long run. It's all about what you make of it. That being said, if your dream is to go Harvard, Yale, or all those other top schools, then go for it! Just don't feel you'll be inadequate if you don't get in, and always make the best out of your undergrad career no matter where you end up.

Have a good day guys

Edit: didn't expect to get so much response! I'm glad if I helped out some struggling high school students.

To clear the air, my school is the University of Texas at El Paso, my major is metallurgical and materials engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering (3.86 GPA if curious. GPA is not a big deal btw, it's moreso your experience) and I currently intern at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

UTEP was not my first choice, and I didn't get accepted to my first choice anyways. However, I don't regret it a single bit. I'm actually really glad I didn't get into my first choice, because I realize now that this school is a good fit.

## [Rising Seniors - NOW Is The Time To Ask About Letters Of Recommendation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bw5h8u/rising_seniors_now_is_the_time_to_ask_about/)
#How To Get Top Letters Of Recommendation That Stand Out From The Stack

#Overview

Letters of recommendation can be very important in college admissions.  But they‚Äôre scary to most students because it feels like you have so little control over how good they are or what they contain.  To an extent that‚Äôs true, but the following has some strategies to help you ensure that your LORs will be as good as the rest of your application.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments, or reach out to me via PM or my website at www.bettercollegeapps.com.

It helps a lot to understand how colleges view LORs.  For example, Yale's admissions site explains:

>"Your high school teachers can provide extremely helpful information in their evaluations. Not only do they discuss your performance in their particular class or classes, but often they write about such things as your intellectual curiosity, energy, relationships with classmates, and impact on the classroom environment. Obviously it is important to ask for recommendations from teachers who know you well."

Princeton‚Äôs admissions site gives some detail on how you should complete this section:

>‚ÄúPlease ask two of your teachers who have taught you in higher-level courses in different academic areas of study to complete and send the teacher recommendation forms, available on the Coalition Application, Common Application and Universal College Application websites. The subjects should be in core academic areas, such as English, foreign language, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and math. All subjects taught at the AP or senior secondary level (including, but not limited to, IB Higher/Standard Level, A-levels, etc.) are acceptable core academic recommendations.‚Äù

These ideas are quite common among top schools.  They want to see specific, detailed LORs with insights into you that do not appear elsewhere in your application.  They also prefer LORs to come from teachers of higher level core courses.  The following guide outlines how to take charge of the process and ensure that your LORs will provide the maximum benefit to your application.

#1.  Selecting a recommender

**Who to pick:**  Usually you are required to submit at least one recommendation from an academic teacher.  You should pick a teacher that you really connected with, and have a relationship beyond class (e.g. you are in EC's he/she sponsors).  Ideally this teacher can speak to your personality, work ethic, and interests beyond simply saying that you got good grades.

**Non-teacher recommendations:**  Many applications also require recommendations from a guidance counselor.  Others may want one from a non-academic mentor such as a coach, manager/employer, volunteer coordinator, religious leader, extracurricular activity sponsor, or other adult in a supervisory role in your life.  Some colleges even want to see a peer recommendation.  In all of these cases, the same general advice applies ‚Äì you want to pick someone who will invest in the letter, make it personal and detailed, and boost your application.

**NOTE:  Do NOT try to manipulate your teachers or counselors, suck up to them, flatter them, or otherwise interact with them solely to get a strong LOR.  This doesn't work very well and is often transparent and hurtful.  Forging strong relationships with teachers is worth it in its own right, but it will help your teachers know you much better when writing LORs too. Meet with them outside of class, participate in class, be engaged in activities they sponsor, etc. This shouldn't be viewed as a manipulative or calculated approach to use them to get a great LOR. Instead it should be viewed as a great way to find a mentor, get support, develop a valuable and rewarding relationship, and make the most of your education.**

**How to pick:**  One way to think about whether the teacher knows you or not is to think about how surprised they would be if they were to read the rest of your college application.  If they already know a lot of what you put in there, they probably know you well enough to write a good recommendation.  If they're going to be shocked to see how involved you are, how well you write, what your interests are, etc. then there might be a better teacher to pick.  If you can't think of one, just pick the one who knows you best, who you also think would give you a good recommendation.

**How NOT to pick:**  Don't pick a teacher just because you got a good grade in their class or you think the admissions officer will be impressed with the recommender.  For example, don't pick the principal of the school just because of the job title if you don't actually have a relationship with him/her.  The only possible exception to this is if the prospective recommender has a prominent role with the university or is a seriously distinguished alumnus.

#2.  Preparation and requesting the recommendation

**Prepare a one page resume or "brag sheet".**  The resume should include all your extracurricular activities, work experience, hobbies, academic stats, awards, and anything else that you're proud of or want to include.  This list should also include your GPA and a brief summary of the higher level classes you've taken (APs, IBs, Dual Enrollment, Honors, etc).  This could also include your love of reading, gaming, coding, woodworking, or anything else you do outside of school. You can also call out anything you want them to mention for you such as a significant impact from an extracurricular activity or personal achievements that aren't explained elsewhere in the application (e.g. you lost a ton of weight, taught yourself a second language, cultivated a fascinating hobby, helped a refugee get his life on track, etc.)  These aren't extracurricular activities in and of themselves really, so if your essays don't mention them, the recommendation is a great place to call them out and drive home the value or impact they had.

**Add some personal details.**  This isn't absolutely necessary, but if you want to, you can also provide a couple bullet points about yourself. This could include topics you're interested in that are related to your application theme/arc/intended major (e.g. "I want to major in Chemistry and I read several academic Chemistry journals/blogs regularly"). It could be a project you worked on that wasn't for school or an activity. It could just talk about how much you love being out in nature or helping kids or being in a lab or working with your hands or taking breathtaking photos.

**Summarize any other necessary details.**  Add some bullet points to the bottom of the page that call attention to anything you want the recommender to mention for you.  This could be some additional reinforcement of your application arc, a challenge you've overcome, a disability or medical condition, a personal achievement that doesn't fit anywhere else on the application, or some other hardship or extenuating circumstance that you want admissions offices to know about.

**Ask early.**  Many students wonder when to ask for a recommendation letter and most procrastinate too long.  Usually, the best time is toward the end of junior year.  This gives the recommender the whole summer to write letters, and the end of a year is typically when your relationship is at its peak level of engagement.  It won't be as hard for the teacher to remember your contributions to her class or other great things to write about you.

**Prepare your rec request elevator pitch.**  In addition to a resume, make a mental list of a few reasons why you're choosing that teacher.  This could be something you loved about their class, something you appreciate about them personally, something you learned that impacted you, or something else great about them or your relationship with them.  When you approach them to ask for a recommendation, tell them these reasons, ask if they would be willing to write a letter of recommendation for you, and then hand your resume to them.  If you want to, you can also write your reasons down on the paper you hand them, but this sometimes feels weird because of how personal it is.  This helps them understand why you chose them and it also gives you a chance to express your gratitude to them for what they've taught you.

**Set expectations.**  After they've agreed, make sure that you let them know how many applications you're filling out so they can be prepared and you won't feel bad later coming back to them for a 15th copy.  Include scholarship applications in this total since these often require recommendations as well and are usually not submitted via Common App or Coalition portals.  Also tell them what your deadlines are and follow up a few days or weeks before each deadline to remind them.  Explain the submission process to them and answer any questions they might have.

The goal of all of this is to lessen their burden, show that you are taking responsibility for the process, and increase the likelihood that your rec letters all arrive to the right places on time.  Your preparation and proactiveness here is another way to impress your recommender and stand out from the other students who are asking them for recommendations.

To summarize, your conversation might go like this:  "Hi Mr. Smith, I've really enjoyed your class and it's one of the reasons I want to major in Chemistry at MIT.  I feel like you made it real and exciting and so much more than just an academic subject - it‚Äôs become a passion of mine.  Would you be willing to write a recommendation letter for my college application?"

"Oh awesome, thanks so much!  Here's a resume for your reference.  Just a heads up ‚Äì I'm planning to apply to eight colleges and several scholarships as well, so I will probably be coming back to you for more copies in the next couple of months.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I really appreciate you doing this ‚Äì at selective schools like MIT, a detailed and specific recommendation letter can make a big difference.  Thanks again!"

#3.  Follow up and follow through

**Make the process easy for your recommender.**  You want to take ownership of this process ‚Äì after all, the rec letters are for your benefit.  For each letter submission deadline, approach your recommender at least a week or more in advance to remind them of it.  Explain what this particular recommendation is for as well as any tweaks you'd like them to make.  For example, "Hi Mr. Smith.  I just wanted to remind you that I'm sending my application to Stanford next week.  I sent you an email this morning with the link to submit your letter of recommendation.  Stanford has a real focus on a start-up culture and entrepreneurial spirit, so if you could highlight my innovative fundraising efforts with the Key Club here at Local High School, that would be awesome.  Thanks again for your help with this important process!"  You could email all of this to him as well if you think that would be more convenient.

**Check your progress.**  Most application portals have a section where you can see what supplemental materials have been submitted including recommendation letters.  You can log in and see whether each one has been received.  If you see one missing, follow up with the recommender to make sure they do it on time and deliver it to the right place.

**Say Thank You.**  Every teacher who writes a recommendation letter for you deserves a thank you note.  This should ideally be hand delivered either midway through your application process or after you've received your first result from an application.  Ideally, this note will be hand-written, but email is certainly better than nothing.

#4.  How much does a recommendation letter weigh in the college admissions process?  What makes a letter great?

Recommendation letter weighting can be tricky because while it certainly varies from school to school, their weight also depends a great deal on the letter itself. I've seen letters that are literally "I recommend John Smith for admission to your school." There's not a lot to work with there, so it's not going to make a big impact either way. I've seen others that gush like crazy for 2 pages and make a real difference.  Great recommendation letters:

-Fit the theme of the app

-Are not too short

-Are personal and detailed (this is the most important one)

-Use superlatives

-Avoid reservations

-Go beyond the template

-Are written by a qualified recommender

-Explain extenuating circumstances if applicable

The more of those things your letter does, the more weight it will be given.  At highly selective schools, most qualified applicants have very similar transcripts, test scores, GPAs, class ranks, and even activities and leadership.  So a great recommendation letter can really make a huge difference.  At less selective schools, many students are automatically admitted based solely on their stats.  The rec letter is literally irrelevant in these cases, except for awarding merit scholarships.

## [Cringe with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ewgak7/cringe_with_me/)
So basically, I'm gobbling down some fries at lunch and scrolling through reddit on my phone. . . Suddenly, a notification pops onto my screen. "You've been admitted into \[INSERT STATE COLLEGE\]." YESSSSS.

So I save this energy for home, and the moment I walk through the front door I find myself in the bathroom jumping up and down, slapping my own ass like a madman. I don't know why I am like this but I am basically slapping both cheeks with my hands and screaming with joy in front of the mirror.  Then, after having done this for maybe a full 2 minutes, I hear the creak of a door.

And this is the part where I actually want to die. My stomach drops and I realize that my Mom has been home the entire time and almost definitely heard everything.

I haven't left my room since.

EDIT: Zoo wee MAMA! Thank you for the Silver!

## [University is awesome. Oh, and a few application tips.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/djem2m/university_is_awesome_oh_and_a_few_application/)
Hi seniors! It's been almost two months since I've started university, and I just wanted to share a few of my thoughts on my university experience so far for y'all:

University is not like high school, where you hang out with the same friend group every day. You get to know a lot more people here, in your dorms, clubs, and classes. You still have a few friends that you hang out more than others, of course, but your social circle really expands. It's really the best of both worlds!

I used to go to a small high school (\~40 people per grade) and now am at a large public university. There's a lot more students here, with a more varied set of backgrounds, interests, and experiences. This means that it's a lot easier to "find your group" in university than in high school, simply because you're more likely to find a group of friends that you vibe with. Also, universities tend to accept people with certain traits, so you may find that you'll share more of the same interests/have similar views or habits with many of your classmates in uni than in high school.

You also have a lot more freedom! As a high schooler, I always heard people say that university is what you make of it, and thought it was really cliche. But it's true: you're free to do anything you want in university, be it sleeping or partying or studying all day. For example, a lot of my classes are webcast, so I don't go to those lectures (not saying that you shouldn't go to lectures--you should show up if you think you need to!) and instead spend that time doing activities I enjoy (club stuff, personal projects...etc). Personally, I loved the freedom, because I'm not stuck in classes that I don't enjoy all day and can really explore what I'm interested in.

Also, there's ALWAYS something going on, whether that be hang outs, club events, or residence hall socials. I'm someone that likes being kept busy, so it's really nice to always have something to do.

A few application tips:

* Brainstorm a few noteworthy stories of accomplishments that you want admissions officers to know. For each of your accomplishments, you should also be able to tell an intriguing story of the obstacles you faced, how you overcame them, and what you learned from the experience. For example: "I won Best Delegate in a national Model UN conference. In the beginning, I felt nervous about presenting in front of a large committee. However, I told myself to not think too much and just give it my best shot. As I delivered my speech, I realized that it wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, and that presenting my ideas and research was actually fun. Through that conference, not only did I gain valuable public speaking and debate skills, I also learned to overcome my fears in situations outside my comfort zone." From a brief outline like that, you can expand your "stories" to full length personal statements or incorporate them into your short essay answers. Oh, and having a few stories like these on hand also helps in interviews!
* Start early: If you haven't started your college apps yet--do it now. It's better to have a bad first draft that you can edit in the coming weeks than a good idea in your head.
* Revise revise revise: When I was applying, I would read over my application essays at least once every two days, and usually I'd be able to catch some mistake/improve some part of my answers every time I read through them. After two months of constant revision, my essays looked A LOT better than their first incarnations. Oh, and ask others to read through your essays as well! Try to find the people who would be the most critical of your essays--they usually give the best advice.
* Keep a copy of all your essays! Many universities ask similar questions, so you can simply copy/paste your answers and tweak them a little to fit each university. Also, don't delete your application essays even after you receive your decisions--you'll find it helpful to have them around when writing club applications in the future.

Good luck with your applications! I know it may seem tough right now, but it only gets better from here :)

## [PSA: A Lot of Honors/Scholarships Applications are Due the Same Day as Early Action App's!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dmf3x6/psa_a_lot_of_honorsscholarships_applications_are/)
Hey guys, as the title says, I just wanted to spread a quick PSA to all of you trying to get both early action & merit scholarship/honors consideration. As I've been completing my applications, I've noticed that while some schools just use your app. for scholarships/honors, some want an additional app. specific to scholarships. I've also noticed that a lot of these require an essay and are due Nov. 1 just like the admission app!!

I can't say how common this is across the board, but in my case half (exactly 50% lol) of the schools I'm applying to want an extra essay due Nov. 1 before any scholarship consideration. Y'all should definitely finish your actual app's before any of these - but if you've got your admissions app's done, make sure to take a look at the honors & scholarship sections of those college sites!!

Good luck to everyone on their college apps!!!

## [It's Ivy Day TODAY!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e2bpa2/its_ivy_day_today/)
7 pm, March 30, 2020, it's Ivy Day. Your Chinese tiger parents have left your cheeks black and blue after both Amherst and Green Mountain Farming University rejected you one week earlier, and you can hardly sit on your hard wooden chair without wincing. 20 safeties, 50 targets, and every single top 20 school besides the ivies have rejected you, citing their increasingly competitive applicant pool.

&#x200B;

Your cheeks are no longer the shape they once were :(

&#x200B;

Dartmouth? Rejected

Brown? Rejected

Cornell? Rejected

Princeton? Rejected

Yale? Rejected

Upenn? Rejected

Columbia? Rejected early (you secretly ED'ed Columbia)

&#x200B;

Finally, you open Harvard's application portal. You've saved this university for last because it means the most to your parents (and your buttcheeks). Mom and Dad have always dreamed about having a child go to Harvard and would force you to dress up as John Harvard, the mascot, every time you went shopping with them since you were only a wee little boy.

In your mind, you are already donning your janitorial uniform and preparing your broom, ready for a life of mediocrity and spankings at your local McDonald's. Suddenly, you receive a new notification. Idaho Potato Harvest Tractor Farm University has extended its deadline for three months just for you! You feel a tiny sliver of hope, but your parents don't want to let you get sidetracked. They want Harvard.

Sweat on your brow, you open the applicant portal, and you read the decision aloud for your parents.

*"It is with genuine regret that I am writing to you to inform you that-"*

Your heart drops, and you feel the sting of rejection yet again. It's your 100th rejection this year (90 universities and 10 girls), but it still hurts just as much as the first one.

However, you have a bigger problem. Your cheeks aren't ready man :(

As your dad steps closer, you desperately continue reading, *"-we had to reject a record number of applicants this year, but you weren't one of them. Congratulations Harvard Student from Class of 2024!"*

You stop reading and go into shock. Those sneaky AO's got you in the first half, but you don't care. At all. You're going to Harvard, a school you never imagined being accepted to, especially after being rejected by Colorado's Grand Canyon Riverbed Raking University who had supposedly extended their early action deadline for 6 months just for you.

You're just happy that your cheeks are safe. GG EZ

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hope everyone gets into their dream school this year and is surprised by good results! Don't lose hope if you get rejected by your early school because everything always works out. Good luck everybody :)

Best wishes from AlexChickenEater, a fellow senior who is applying to college

So, my best friend got into Columbia yesterday. While we were screaming in her car and filming a really bad decision video, I was busy posting a cute little photo on my Instagram story of her. Scrolling through, I see many people, close friends of mine that go to different schools, people I did programs with, all doing the same thing. In 20 minutes on my phone, I saw six people going to Harvard. Three going to Princeton, five going to Duke. I have a friend who was accepted to Emory yesterday, and one to Notre dame qb.  I know personally three people going to NYU and two going to Stanford. And every single one I smiled bright and was super excited to text them holy hell you‚Äôre going to ______!!

This is my favorite part of the process. Getting to see the amazing people I know get what they deserve, the acceptances they worked so hard for. It‚Äôs amazing.
It hurt a lot to see some my friends got rejected from their dream schools. But, I know that in a year, it won‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôll be happy. They‚Äôll be living it up somewhere. And in the end, I am so proud of all of them.

## [AOs Can't Actually Detect "Authenticity" Or "Passion": Hot Take From A Stanford Senior (repost)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/)
Last year during decision day I posted an essay about why I think elite universities like Stanford or Harvard can't actually detect authenticity or passion. I thought I'd share it again this year to console all you seniors about your rejections. I'm on a new account because I couldn't log into my throwaway account again.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

"So, what do you like to do in your free time?"

"I like hiking and naturery stuff" I said.

"That's not academic enough. Anything else?"

"Uh idk. I like art I guess," I choked.

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something "community-minded" with my interests. "How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some "buzzwords" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said "yes, (my name) would love to do that."

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how "I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey," but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they "could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment."**

So yeah, "an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color"... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. \*\*Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.\*\*Sure, there are some exceptions.

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of "ditching your high school self" and "getting to live a little for the next 4 years" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.**(There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some high school students say "just follow your passion" and "we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about" or "to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;" and the worst one, "be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself." **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

TL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.

&#x200B;

Edit from this year: A sophomore at Stanford who's kinda Twitter famous had this one tweet that read:

***Elite universities are pillars of a colonial past, present, and future. Institutions like st\*nford, h\*rvard, etc. are not meant to mold free thinkers, only the next generation of capitalists & imperialists.***

Think about that the next time you see a Stanford or Harvard grad proclaiming to do good for the world in their college apps only to do a complete 180 flip (\*cough [pete buttigieg](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete) cough\*).

&#x200B;

edit: thank you for the best of a2c award!

She keeps sending me links to all these different essay guides and wholesome posts and whatnot. She's so motivated seeing how helpful and driven y'all are.

She isn't as nervous for me about the college process.  She's learning so much about how brand-names aren't important and how the process should be about your passions and what make you happy. I'm so proud of her and so grateful for y'all! Best part is when she asks me if I've seen a recent meme lol. Thank you a2c for being the bestest sub ever that you managed to teach my hardened mother about college!

## [friendly reminder to always have your interviews in a public place!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f1cgpl/friendly_reminder_to_always_have_your_interviews/)
in light of u/collegethrowaway9301 ‚Äòs recent post about sexual harassment in college interviews, i‚Äôd like to remind you to have your interviews in a public place.

when i had my yale interview, the man told me it would be at his house. i looked it up and saw that you should NEVER interview at someone‚Äôs house, but i was too afraid to tell him that i would rather it be at a starbucks instead.

i regret that now, because this man made me so uncomfortable. there were 3 couches in his room, but he chose to sit directly next to me. he told me that a girl like me didn‚Äôt have to worry about getting good grades because i should have fun and date and be a little wild in college like he was. he said that i looked like his wife when she was my age. he called me attractive so many times‚Äîmore than my ex did in a day. he told me that he‚Äôd come visit me if i got in. there‚Äôs more, but for the sake of not being too long-winded, i‚Äôll stop.

he walked me out to my car and his mood completely shifted when he saw that my mom had driven me there (because she was also worried about me meeting a stranger). he told her that she had a ‚Äúvery attractive daughter‚Äù and then got his mail and walked in.

if i hadn‚Äôt been at his house i would have felt much less in danger. he didn‚Äôt know my mom was outside‚Äîhe could have assaulted me and even if i reported it he‚Äôs so rich he could have made it go away. he could have hurt me in so many ways and i thank god so much that my mom was waiting for me with a tracker on my phone.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have your interviews in a public place. have them in a starbucks, in a chick fil a, have them in an arby‚Äôs. i don‚Äôt care. just anywhere but their home or a secluded forest or whatever. prioritize your safety. let my error be a lesson on your part.

## [Rejection from a top school...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/evltjp/rejection_from_a_top_school/)
Dear Applicant,

Thank you for your interest in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The Admissions Committee has carefully considered your application and we regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission in the entering class of 2020, or a position on one of our alternate lists. This year's application pool was the strongest in the School‚Äôs history, and we are unable to offer admission to every student.

Normally, we would state that this decision has no reflection on your abilities; however, there is a first time for everything. As stated on our website, we have geographic boundaries, and we normally do not allow admission to those residing outside of Britain. However, as your parents are British, we decided to consider your application. We would recommend that next time you state your relationship to the English, you do not write that your ‚Äúgrandfather was a famous British man who hid his gun up his butt to hide the fact he was a criminal.‚Äù

We also would like to remind you that Hogwarts is a school for eleven to seventeen-year-olds. We do allow transfers, but not for last years. We certainly did not appreciate that you stated that you were fifteen when you are actually eighteen. Furthermore, you were extremely inappropriate during your interview, as you attempted to kiss Professor Granger. Professor Granger certainly did not enjoy it when you ran out of the coffee shop yelling ‚Äúit‚Äôs legal!‚Äù

Lastly, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a school for people with magical abilities. Although it was entertaining watching the clip, we regret to inform you that waving a branch at a potato connected to a moving fan whilst screaming ‚Äúlevitate!‚Äù is not magic.

We greatly appreciate your interest in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and offer our best wishes of success as you pursue your educational goals.

Yours Sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall

Deputy Headmaster

## [Admissions broke me and I want everyone to know they don‚Äôt have to break you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/efh3em/admissions_broke_me_and_i_want_everyone_to_know/)
Merry Christmas everyone! I just discovered this subreddit last night and was just absolutely fascinated by the content on this subreddit. I see a tremendous amount of good information, bad information, and misinformation. I just wanted to share with you all what it‚Äôs like going to college since I‚Äôve just graduated and what that admissions process looked like for me.

As a senior in high school in 2014-2015, I had a ton of the same aspirations as the rest of the people on this subreddit. I had 4.0 GPA out of 4.0 (5th in my class) and 2120 on my SAT when it was out of 2400 (1460 composite with Math and English). To digress slightly, I just also want to tell everyone you can absolutely improve your SAT/ACT if you work hard enough, my PSAT was an 1080 Math and English composite. I forgot what I got on my two SAT II‚Äôs but both were in the 760+ range. All 5‚Äôs on my half-dozen AP tests in a variety of subjects. I was a varsity level soccer player, an Eagle Scout, and the President of the Literary Magazine. However, I was also a white, middle-class Long Islander who went to a Catholic high school. I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be getting any extra bumps on my applications but I was certain I would be able to stand out.

I don‚Äôt blame my college guidance counselor for setting me up for anything, but she motivated me to apply to a lot of top programs on the East Coast and led me to believe that I can get into any of them, barring maybe one or two universities.

I had a ton of high hopes. I applied to 18 colleges (something I totally discourage anyone from doing, it really should be 8-12 tops). It required a tremendous amount of effort, it was expensive, and if you‚Äôre a good student like I was, it can totally cripple your ability to make a decision come time. I sacrificed every waking moment that I wasn‚Äôt in school or doing something else for extracurriculars applying to colleges.

The process was extremely tedious, frustrating, and aggravating. However, once those January deadlines hit, all I had to do was wait.

In the meantime, my school had even nominated me for the Jefferson Scholarship at the University of Virginia. I then went through their own tedious application process. Thankfully, I was asked to interview and was then later told I was a finalist for the NYC area and would likely be invited to the final interview/selection process at UVA. I was elated. I truly thought I was going anywhere I wanted and my unstoppable work ethic (which I now realize was unhealthy) had finally payed off. My parents had assured me that I could go anywhere as well, depending on if they were good enough. I had a college fund, but I also have two siblings so it wasn‚Äôt substantial.

When everything began to come back, it started off extremely well. On a whim I had applied to Creighton (I love Big East basketball) and was shocked to find a package that included a full-ride offer and a handwritten letter from the Head of Admissions practically begging me to attend. There was also an offer to pay for my flight and accommodations to Omaha considering I hadn‚Äôt visited the campus. Everything was going great. Early action admissions came back and all of them included near or total scholarships, as well as acceptance into their honors programs. My life felt like a film about great success and overcoming hardship. I was happy about these admissions results, but none of the really top programs had gotten back to me yet at this point and of course I wasn‚Äôt going to attend any of these *peon* schools (if you couldn‚Äôt tell, I was becoming arrogant).

Then February and March arrived. On the same day, I was deferred from UVA and denied from the Jefferson Scholarship, denied from Columbia, and waitlisted at Williams College. I was later denied from Georgetown (a school I legitimately thought was a safety for me, but I later learned they hadn‚Äôt accepted a student from my high school in 10+ years) and received no money from Boston College or Notre Dame. Schools I thought would give me more money ended up giving me none or not enough. I was also later denied from UVA and Williams College altogether.

Devastation doesn‚Äôt begin to describe what I felt. It‚Äôs normal to be upset about these types of things, but it‚Äôs not normal to refuse to eat for multiple days and either be crying or on the verge of tears at all waking hours. When I told my college guidance counselor about the results, all she could do was say she was sorry. I think she realized what she might‚Äôve done and apologized to my parents for setting me up with these types of expectations. My parents told me how proud of me they were everyday but it didn‚Äôt matter. I genuinely felt worthless and stupid. I wanted to kill myself.

The worst part of this whole experience was that I also began to resent people who I considered my friends. I had a friend who was being *sued* by Columbia because she applied early decision only for her to be accepted into MIT and she pulled out. Multiple people I knew with worse SAT‚Äôs, extracurriculars, and GPA were all getting money from and/or into the schools I wanted to attend. Every word of reassurance became white noise. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and felt like my life was over.

It is now the end of April and my parents are begging me to decide on what college to attend. I just start listing off the schools in terms of their rankings.

‚ÄúNotre Dame‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too expensive.‚Äù

‚ÄúBoston College‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too expensive.‚Äù

‚ÄúFordham‚Äù

‚ÄúYour scholarship isn‚Äôt big enough.‚Äù

We then get to the schools that I can feasibly attend at their price range.  The thing is I didn‚Äôt want to attend any of them; they were beneath me and the work I had accomplished. I was completely obstinate to the reality of the situation. They said ‚Äúyou can basically attend these 4-5 colleges,‚Äù but they were really hoping I picked the one that multiple people in my town had attended and reportedly loved. However, I had hated my tour of the place and simply did not want to go there. The school did though offer me a 60% scholarship and entrance into their Honors Program. They even told me that a family friend‚Äôs daughter, who had been accepted into UVA, chose to attend this school and loved it. I was really upset and tried to stop myself from crying through the whole process, but I ultimately trusted their judgement.

I can say with definite certainty that I tried to like the place I attended. I joined clubs, tried to meet people in the dorms, went to sporting events, etc. It just wasn‚Äôt working. I was so lonely and sad and angry about everything that I shut down. I still attended class and finished my first semester with a 4.0 having taken 19 credits, but it all felt hollow. I was dead-set on transferring out of there and was certain with my performance in college thus far, anywhere would be accessible. Someone had even told me transferring is the way to get into some of these programs.

Not only was I rejected from all the top schools I had applied to the previous year, but I was rejected from some schools that had previously offered me scholarships! I was also beginning to hear from my friends who were a year younger than me getting into these programs I had wanted to attend, which hurt me further. With limited options, I realized I would have to graduate from my current college. I would be stuck there for four years.

I‚Äôve used the word devastation before, but it doesn‚Äôt really encapsulate the absolute darkness that encompassed me. I began to think I was an alien (not like a space alien). I felt like I had been lied to and that the world was for other people and not for me.

At this point in time, I now recognize in hindsight that I was in the process of developing serious undiagnosed depression. I began to sleep for 16 hours a day and felt tired while I was awake. I would only eat when I felt I was about to faint from exhaustion/malnutrition. I kept trying to make friends and make the most out of my experience, but nothing was working. By the end of the year, I had been denied from the two clubs on campus that had the closest thing to a family bond/fraternity vibe to them.

Every day I thought about killing myself (I even took up smoking as a nonviolent way of slowly killing myself). I thought about the girl at Brown down the road who didn‚Äôt deserve her spot there while I lived in the closest thing to Hell on earth. I would pray to God every night begging him to tell me where I went wrong.

I returned for my sophomore year in an even worse condition. I was eating less and sleeping even more. I was sleeping so much I was going to bed at 6PM and having trouble getting up for 8:30AM lectures. I looked awful. I had hair down to my back (I‚Äôm a guy), didn‚Äôt shower, and smoked half-a-pack of cigarettes a day. I couldn‚Äôt even do my work anymore, the one thing I valued myself on through my entire life. It was long process that will make a long story even longer, but this all culminated in me medically withdrawing from school in the Fall of my Junior Year.

It took 9 months of therapy, medication, and love, but I willed myself back to that campus determined to just basically finish and get out of there.

I don‚Äôt know what it was, but a paradigm shift in my perspective occurred. I would like to state that I always thought my professors there were brilliant, I was just unhappy about the prestige of the school and my abysmal social life. But I began to realize that that these people are here because they (1) got offered a job in an extremely competitive field, and (2) because they themselves are extremely qualified. I don‚Äôt know why it took me so long, but the ‚Äúesoteric knowledge‚Äù of the books I was reading was not limited to the faculty and resources in the schools I had wanted to attend. This made me feel substantially better about the education I was receiving. I also began to make genuine steps towards making friends. I was able to join one of the clubs I had been denied from in my freshman year. Funny enough, one of their responsibilities was giving tours! I was happy for the first time in a while.

Nevertheless, it was still difficult. My depression robbed me of much of the work ethic I once possessed. It took much more effort to do the same activities I could do with ease as a senior in high school or as a freshman. This means I did not graduate with a 4.0 (3.6, barely cum laude). However, I grew to love my school. It was a long and complex time, and I graduated a semester late, but I‚Äôm happy I went there. Apparently, I‚Äôm poised to win the top English prize for my senior thesis and am presenting at the Senior Symposium. Just to have the opportunity to thank my school and my professors for their help and guidance would be an incredible opportunity.

I wrote this down as a way of expressing to others the obscene damage that the expectations you put on yourself can do to you. To be fair, I think I always predisposed to depression considering my fragile emotional state and this might‚Äôve developed later in life but that‚Äôs beside the point. The catalyst for this all was my college applications. Hell, it mattered so much to me that when my dad told me that a family friend‚Äôs son had gotten into Yale a few days ago, I nearly cried and I‚Äôm already out of college. It‚Äôs fucking pathetic (but I recognize it‚Äôs fucked up and I‚Äôm still working on fixing myself).

But I‚Äôm not like most people. I was an elitist who wanted to join elitist institutions. I still do to an extent. I‚Äôm looking at all these scores on these tests that you guys post about and there‚Äôs tinges of envy popping up inside of me. Some of you might even think I was delusional for ever thinking I could go to those top programs in the first place, but hey, I and no one here will ever know why things turned out the way they did. But I also recognize now that for me to have been this upset about college admissions when I knew how things would turn out, I have no idea why I was so upset.

The thing is though, opportunity has found its way into every facet of my life. When God shut doors, he always opened windows whether I knew it or not. I‚Äôve learned so much at college about my majors and myself it‚Äôs hard to think I could‚Äôve wanted it any other way. I just want people to know that I know how rough and disappointing it can be. It‚Äôs not fair. But it‚Äôs also not designed to be fair. Don‚Äôt let these things stop you from becoming the person you are meant to be. I should‚Äôve been able to see the overwhelming amount of positivity I received earlier in the process and realized just how much these schools were wrong about me. You will be accomplished anywhere you go. Don‚Äôt let *anyone* tell you that you‚Äôre not good enough. What some admissions officer thinks about your application is not indicative of who you are as a human being. It is not the total indictment of character and intelligence that I thought it was.

I know this is so long and I genuinely respect anyone who‚Äôs read to the end of this, but if I have only one piece of advice for anyone here, it‚Äôs be kind to yourself. I was so profoundly unkind to myself for so long that my brain stopped working correctly.

This will not define you. This goes both ways. Going to a ‚Äúlesser‚Äù college means nothing of your intelligence. One of the biggest losers I know went to Columbia and he‚Äôs still a fucking loser a year after he graduated. It‚Äôs what you make of it.

Enjoy your senior year of high school. Meet people. Have sex. Make mistakes. Drink too much. Discover what you love. Find out who you are. That‚Äôs what college is for and nearly any place will give you this opportunity.

## [to those putting down others for their acceptances...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fio1gp/to_those_putting_down_others_for_their_acceptances/)
Dear A2C,

&#x200B;

As we increasingly get notified of our college decisions, I've been noticing a lot of toxicity regarding waitlists/rejections. The problem isn't about feeling bad regarding the results. I get that. You're sad, disappointed, and maybe even angry. You deserve to have time to mourn those hopes you cultivated for months, or even years. It hurts, and I get that, but don't forget to pick up your crowns when you're through it my kings/queens. What's meant to be is meant to be.

&#x200B;

The problem here, though, is not that, it's the people bitching about their waitlists/rejections by either (1) putting down the school or (2) putting down others who got accepted by comparing stats. I have a problem with one more than the other. For issue (1), I get that it's a natural and common coping mechanism given all of those "make me hate \[this school\]" posts on here both before and after decision times, but you need to be more sensitive to those who have those schools as their dream schools/similar. For example, WashU two days days ago was toxic as fuck. People saying "WashU was my safety," or "WashU is the lowest ranked T20," or "WashU yield protected me" after the decisions came out is complete bullshit because putting the school in that context puts down the accomplishments of those accepted. I get the need to preserve your ego, but shitting on a school on an online forum that anyone can see is an asshole move. Why? Shitting on a school that could've been someone's dream school, someone's end goal, someone's life-- is an asshole move. Seriously. It's not hard to see.

&#x200B;

But that's not even the worse of it.

&#x200B;

Issue (2) is the most disgusting thing you could do, ESPECIALLY if you're shitting on someone on here who got accepted and posted their stats. It's one thing to shit on someone you know, but another to do it behind a computer screen to someone you don't. Ya'll compare scores and EC's like it's nothing, shitting on people without a 35+ ACT/1550+ SAT/4.0 UW/4.8+ W and/or national/international recognition, without even considering things like essays and recs. And lemme tell you, a lot of those are a mess. I've dabbled in creative writing my whole life and so when I volunteered to read essays during apps season, both online and off, I thought everyone's writing skill was somewhat comparable to mine-- an assumption that could not have been more wrong. I must've read some 30+ common app essays and I can only remember two that were actually good in the first time read. And yes, some 25/30+ were from A2C. You can have your stacked scores and EC's, but many of your essays aren't as good as you think: what you rate as an 9/10 can be someone else's 2/10. Same goes for recs. Stop assuming that you can make judgements based on what you deem as important, especially to a stranger online who is trying to celebrate their accomplishments. Some of you really need to be humbled some time soon, it's pathetic watching it.

&#x200B;

So what can you do if you get waitlisted/rejected? You can wallow, wallow as much as you want. But don't put down other people, especially those who got accepted, for the sake of your ego.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

A fed-up A2C senior.

## [Putting TikTok on my college app](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ci2dhn/putting_tiktok_on_my_college_app/)
Hi guys, also no this is not a troll post lol

I have over 75k followers on TikTok and am wondering if I should put it on my college app.  All of my videos are very family friendly, literally none of them have any swears or offensive capability.  In addition, I have sort of an environmental spike in my app and a lot of my TikToks are environmental.  The video that got me ‚Äúpopular‚Äù was environmental and has 6.2m views.   This is a big part of my life so I feel like I should put it.  Any input?

Seriously, they need to stop including loans in your financial aid award values. I got an email saying that I was awarded enough aid to cover the costs of one of my colleges, only to look at the report and see that $27,000 of it was from Unsubsidized/Parent PLUS loans.

## [School shaming can really hurt people, so why do it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fjlrbu/school_shaming_can_really_hurt_people_so_why_do_it/)
I saw a post to a similar effect last week; I hope this is meaningful and to the point.

School shaming, whether it be an earnest chuckle or snide remark about ranking, will NEVER make someone feel nice inside. Whether the intentions be in good spirit or malicious, the only outcome is tainting what should be the happy memory of a fellow senior. Getting accepted to school, from a dream college to a safety, might be the best moment of someone‚Äôs HS career; why would you taint this memory by casting doubt and embarrassment over a peer?

In closing, I have a small bit of advice that, while applicable to many situations, is especially relevant during this time: before commenting on a university a peer or stranger was accepted to, think of how it may impact the person in question and whether or not it would smear what should be a happy memory. Don‚Äôt be the person who creates embarrassment and sadness; support your friends and redditers *even* if you dislike the school they were accepted to!

Many people will not tell you that your comments upset them; we all need to keep this in mind.

If I get into a college,I‚Äôll start working out regularly to get hot in time for college.

If I don‚Äôt get into college, I won‚Äôt have to work out.

It‚Äôs a win-win situation

Edit: this is starting to gain heat so imma make it interesting for myself- if I get into college, I‚Äôll add an extra second to my 17 minutes on the treadmill for every upvote. If I dont get in, I‚Äôll eat an extra dorito for every upvote from a cheesy Doritos bag

## [Is anyone else realizing how shitty of a person they are?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cfr3yh/is_anyone_else_realizing_how_shitty_of_a_person/)
warning this is a lowkey long rant.

after so much introspection i‚Äôve realized that literally my only goal in getting into a great school is for the validation i‚Äôll have. it‚Äôs making me doubt myself and my entire work ethic.

my passions boil down to two things: math and lgbt culture i guess.

when i was little kid i did so much math on my own because i thought i‚Äôd get peoples respect since not a lot of people liked me. even though i grew up fine and made friends, i think i only really liked math because it was easy and made me feel good. this might not be a good example, butwhen making the transition to olympiad level math i constantly stopped studying and practicing because i was bored. there really was no application of olympiad level math for me, especially since my school never offered a competition, but i feel like my straying away from something i ‚Äúlove‚Äù is indicative of how shallow my interest in it is. that being said, i do love the thought of taking advanced courses in college. i just have no intrinsic motivation to do it and i just don‚Äôt know why (could be depression, lowkey always sluggish and losing passion in everything lol,  but i‚Äôm not tryna self diagnose lol)

but now, after watching a couple of tv shows and having my entire existence subdued in nyc ballroom culture videos i can tell that i am really passionate about the history and movement of culture in the lgbt community. i love voguing even though i am literally garbage at it and i can‚Äôt really feel liberated in any other sense. but what is the point of college if all i would want to do is just kinda‚Ä¶ dance on my own?

honestly, after writing all of this i‚Äôve made some revelations about myself. does my entire existence depend on getting into the college of my dreams‚Ä¶ just to impress other people?? do i really care if i make $100,000/yr with my intended career versus $140,000/yr when either way i‚Äôll end up happy and comfortable? does it really matter that much to me to flex on friends and family just for my success to be irrelevant to their love in the long run anyways? what have i been doing with all this time, dreading the day i‚Äôll have to read a rejection letter that i only could have expected when i lost my entire personality in this process?

## [Class of 2020 survey results](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e0a1it/class_of_2020_survey_results/)
Hey everyone. Yesterday, I posted a brief survey for everyone here applying to college. I was expecting 100 responses at most but was blown away that there were over 1500 (and counting). As promised, here is an overview of the data. If you'd like the raw data, I'll post the link to the Google Sheet below.

&#x200B;

The survey is still open and if you'd like to take it, click [here](https://forms.gle/boWq4E6MPAi7rz9r6).

If your data/spreadsheet interpretation skills are above mine which are mediocre, dm me and I'll make you a collaborator on the Google Sheet. I'd love to go further into the data by looking at correlations between income and SAT score, what the average SAT score for each top college is, etc.

&#x200B;

Let's get into the data

91% of us have applied so far but only 59% have been accepted

On average, we have applied to 5.3. This was not my original calculation because respondent 733 chose to write in 2E27.

In order, most of us have applied early action (73%), regular/rolling decision (63%), and early decision (33%), and via QuestBridge (3.5%)

Our most popular school type is state/public (86% of us are applying to these),  followed by T-20's (75%), Ivy leagues (55%), Liberal Arts colleges and other private colleges are both being applied to by about 37% of us, and HBCU's by 1.7%

Stanford is out number one #1 with 123 marking this as their first choice. This is followed by MIT 91) Penn (70), and Yale (66)

Computer science seems to be our biggest major according to 240 of us. I wasn't sure how to search the spreadsheet to find the #2 since they were so close.

It is settled. Joe is, in fact, your mama.

Our average SAT reading/writing score was 720, and the average math score was 730

For ACT it goes 33 (English), 35 (math), 33 (reading), 32 (science)

On average, we're taking 7.1 AP exams, and between all 1526 respondents at the moment, we have taken a total of 9,730.  (The math doesn't seem to add up but this is what Google Sheets is telling me)

a plurality of us have a perfect unweighted GPA (20%) followed by a 3.7 (6.5%). Our composite GPA is 3.797

The vast majority of us go to high schools that do not rank (56%). After this, 15% of us are in the top 10 in our class, 11% are in the top 10%, and 8% in the top 20%.

Most of us who live in the US live in the Northeast (33%), then the West (24%), then the Southeast (20%), the Midwest (18%), and the Southwest (7.8%)

Most of us are not international students as 1012 left this question blank. Of those who answered, North America was the most popular answer (54%)  (probably a fluke as some people didn't know you could skip this question. My bad). The next most popular continents were Asia (25%), Antarctica (16%, lol), Europe (5.4%), Africa (2.7%), South America (1.2%--just 6 people), and Australia (0.58%‚Äîjust 3 people)

We are more male (59.9%) than female (36.7%). 1.3% prefer not to answer and 1.1% marked other. Shoutout to u/admissionsmom for dealing with all the teenage dudes

The vast majority go to a public school (66%), then a secular private school (12%), a private religious (8.8%), and magnet (4.7%)

40.1% of us think our school's academics are pretty good (4/5), then 29.7% say they‚Äôre very good (5/5) followed by 3/5 (21%), and 2/5 (6.8%) and 1/5 at 1.6%.

68% of us live in the suburbs, 25% are urban, and 7.8 are rural

33.8% say their mental health is good, 32.6% say it's in between, and 17.9% say its poor. Hang in there.

33.4% of us get 6-7 hours of sleep a night, 28.5% get 5-6, 15.4% get 7-8, and six of us get two or less (RIP)

50% of us identify as white/caucasian, 42.4% as Asian, 10.5% as Hispanic/Latino, and 7.2% as black/African American

79% of us come from a stable home, 10.9% don't, and 8.9 don't know.

Our most common net income is between $100-150K (14%), then $200-300k (11.4%), followed by 300k-1M (11.1%), and 10.8% don't know

To us, a college's academic quality is the most critical determinant (60% had it ranked 5/5). This is followed by campus life (29.4%), financial aid (26.6%), location (20.8%), and ranking (10.8%).

We are pretty set on getting into our top college with 61% saying it is 4/5 or 5/5 important that they get in. Only 13% don't mind if they don't (1/5, 2/5). 55.5% of us care if we only get into our safeties. 22% don't and another 22% don't know.

Thank you so much for taking this survey. I hope we can learn a good deal from it. Let me know if there are any questions I should add or any trends I should look for in the data. Sorry for my atrocious grammar and best of luck to all of you in your applications and your endeavors in college.

Here s the link to a spreadsheet of the raw data

## [He got in](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ebmmcz/he_got_in/)
A close friend got into Yale today.

I have an 8th period release, but I stayed with him in the back office of the science lab, waiting the extra half hour to witness his decision notification.  I must have been just as anxious as he was, sitting on my hands and bouncing up and down while he paced back and forth.  Finally, his portal updated.

It was a black screen.  He zoomed out to see a video screen, just waiting for him to press play.

*Congratulations!*

I never really understood the feeling that redditors have felt when a friend got in.  Probably because I hadn't experienced it before.  But now I know.  It is just as exciting watching your friend jump up and down as it is to get accepted yourself.  We've both edited each other's essays and fretted over finishing in time together.  I sat next to him in class, I watched all the hard work he put into his application, and now I've watched all that hard work pay off.  It was incredibly exciting for me to see him celebrate, and I don't think I could describe the feeling if I tried.

Marcus, if you read this, congratulations.  I am proud of you.

If anyone‚Äôs confused she taught my elder brother before me and asked me if there was something private I wanted her to write.

She spoke to my mother on the phone rn and it turns out that ‚Äòwriting his sister‚Äôs recommendation is the least she can do for that child‚Äô.

I mean yea, it‚Äôs not as if I‚Äôve lived in the shadow of my overachieving brother my entire life, my teacher doesn‚Äôt even consider me a student

My grades are declining in her subject and I was super worried about that but this just blows it out of the water

Feels so fucking dehumanizing

Anyways, thanks for listening to my rant, I don‚Äôt have anyone irl I can talk to :( gonna go cry in the bathroom now

## [To the College Class of 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqqxf5/to_the_college_class_of_2025/)
I‚Äôm not pulling punches when I say the next year is gonna be brutal. You will second guess yourself. You will be intimidated and afraid. You‚Äôll be uncertain and anxious to the point where you want to pull your hair out or destroy your laptop with a Quentin Tarantino explosion.

I‚Äôm going to do my best to give you some advice cause this thread has given me a lot.

1. Don‚Äôt believe everything you see hear on A2C or College Confidential or whatever. You will rarely see a full story with all the facts or circumstances. They‚Äôre decent things to read but don‚Äôt try to extrapolate anything about your own chances. In the long run, this will give you more blood pressure spikes than helpful information.

2. That being said, remember you‚Äôre all in the same boat together. Don‚Äôt be afraid to help those around you because of competition or something. The world is bigger than just us and you‚Äôre gaining nothing by withholding help. So share those deadlines and scholarship links and helpful resources.

3. Start early. Use this break or virus vacation or whatever to start exploring your options and programs of interest. It‚Äôs ok to be unsure but start have a a general idea of how you want the next four years to pan out. You don‚Äôt need to set anything in stone at all. Look at what interests you, what factors matter to you as you make a college list, and so on. Make a first draft of a list you want to apply to. Spend just 20 minutes if you can going through official college websites. That‚Äôs the most authentic source of information from everything from general inquiries to super specific details.

4. I‚Äôve come to realize that there are maybe 500 kids in the world each year who could basically get into any place they want. These include everyone from ISEF winners to International Olympiad winner and Greta Thunburgs. For the rest of us...we‚Äôre honestly slugging it out on a big playing field. This is why a balance list is important. It‚Äôs not just generic blog advice but seriously something to ponder. What I thought was a safety in my freshman year waitlisted me and nearly all of my very qualified friends. Genuinely have three schools you will definitely get into unless some catastrophe happens. I can‚Äôt understate the importance of this.

5. Let‚Äôs move on to fit. We‚Äôve all got subtle biases from prestige to rankings to where our family has gone. As you go on to college it‚Äôs also time to take more ownership for your choices. The world can give you all the advice it has but you‚Äôre going to need to live the next four years. What was my ED application thankfully rejected me and I genuinely realized (without any bitterness) that I would have hated four years there and an amazing major would not have compensated. As much as possible try to talk to current students here or wherever. A lot of schools let you talk to current students so make use of that.

6. Applications nearly killed me no joke. In hindsight applying to twenty five places was just me being an idiot. But I can‚Äôt expect you to make a better choice because at the end of the day, that worry is simply too much sometimes. So plan out your essays with plenty of time. Make a schedule and try to stick to it. One of the best things I did was throw everything onto a google calendar and wake up to see reminders. That really helped me remember what was current and pending.

7. Decisions decisions decisions. You‚Äôre gonna get a lot and have to make a lot. Its going to be a confusing time. As ‚ÄúA Tale of Two Cities‚Äù says, it‚Äôs going to be the best of times and the worst times. There‚Äôs nothing quite like the high of acceptance. The highs are very high and the lows are very low.

Here‚Äôs how you should think of it. It‚Äôs going to look random. It‚Äôll be heartbreaking that you didn‚Äôt get in if you were rejected. I like to think that a school could throw out their entire accepted class, and make a better or equivalent one from the people they rejected because there ARE just so many good people. Also, I like to think that in most cases, well qualified people might be lucky enough to get in, but no unqualified person ever lucked in. So don‚Äôt hate on people who go to your dream schools if you can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm kinda guilty of this right now but it‚Äôs honestly the best thing I can say.

This is getting long so I‚Äôm gonna wrap up.

My dad said before I opened my decisions, ‚ÄúSon, pedigree or prestige is neither necessary nor sufficient to be successful in life.‚Äù Undergrad isn‚Äôt the end of anything and the journey isn‚Äôt ending anytime soon. Don‚Äôt peak in college. There‚Äôs a lot out there for us to go and college isn‚Äôt an endpoint.

So to all the juniors. Go make us proud. I‚Äôll be lurking around smiling as I recall my own tiring but awesome trip. I wish the best for all of you and I‚Äôve got no doubt you‚Äôre gonna be awesome.

And to A2C, thanks to my second family. You‚Äôre all amazing!!!!

Sincerely
A random emotional high-on-life ex high schooler

## [Seeing people turn down their dream colleges because of the tuition makes me sad...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eh54a6/seeing_people_turn_down_their_dream_colleges/)
Recently got accepted into my ED which costs a lot of money to attend and is quite prestigious (around t20). I can afford it luckily but seeing people on the sub turning down their dream college because they can‚Äôt afford it breaks my heart? Idk i guess this is just life. I deserve to attend but I also feel a sense of guilt? What can i do about it?

## [My plan to reform the admissions system (Ivy League)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpysyh/my_plan_to_reform_the_admissions_system_ivy_league/)
if a kid gets into Harvard, Cornell, Brown, and Dartmouth, 95% of the time he/she‚Äôs choosing Harvard. But this is problematic because he/she can only enroll at 1 school, and is essentially taking the spots of people who didn‚Äôt get in (but would go) to Cornell, Brown, and Dartmouth. So pretty much I propose a ranking system that follows QuestBridge‚Äôs system that would spike up yields at all ivies and make it easier for ‚Äúunique students‚Äù (non unique = students admitted into 2 or more ivies) to get into the Ivy League.

So pretty much under this system you rank schools based on the order u want to attend
1. Harvard
2. Yale
3. Princeton
4. UPenn
5. Columbia
6. Brown
7. Dartmouth
8. Cornell

let‚Äôs say you applied to all 8 and ranked them. So you‚Äôre first considered for admission for Harvard. If you get in, your admission consideration is DONE. You‚Äôre not considered for the other 7.

If you don‚Äôt get into Harvard, you‚Äôre considered for admission at Yale. If you don‚Äôt get in, you‚Äôre considered at Princeton, and so on. This system ensures that you don‚Äôt have to go against the kids that get into multiple ivies (who take your spot).

Let‚Äôs say Cornell gets 40,000 applications. But under this system, maybe they‚Äôll actually only read 32,000? The thing is tho, that 8000 applicant differential is the best of the best ‚Äî the 8000 kids who would, under the current system, likely get in over that Cornell reject.


counter argument #1: waitlist is the same thing

Let‚Äôs say there are 4 applicants. 2 Harvard kids (A and B) and 2 Cornell kids (C and D) and someone not good enough for either (E).

Current system: A, B, C accepted. D waitlisted. A and B go to Harvard. 99.8% of the time D wouldn‚Äôt get off the waitlist. In other words, waitlist is useless pretty much and they‚Äôre forced to go to a non ivy school.

My System: C, D accepted, E has a much better chance of getting into Cornell (cuz A and B didn‚Äôt take his spot)


counter argument #2: this would be detrimental for people who need to compare financial aid.

although all ivy leagues pretty much offer the same financial aid, as for the financial aid situation, maybe there would be a universal Ivy League financial aid system ? Would have to think more about that

This would mainly help for the whole yield rate thing. Let‚Äôs say Cornell admits 5000 and they expect 2000 to enroll. If 2050 actually enroll then thats obv not good. Essentially colleges having to worry about predicting yield rates would become defunct

Also, under this system there wouldn‚Äôt be a discrepancy in the competition of accepted and enrolled

## [my backpack predicted the end of high school!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fznzys/my_backpack_predicted_the_end_of_high_school/)
Just thought I'd share this (kind of) cool story with this sub, you guys have all been so helpful to me! When I was in the seventh grade my mom bought me a backpack after my previous one had ripped. Now I was beyond excited to have this backpack as it was the kind that had so many pockets you forgot where they all were and whistle that you could blow on if you ever found yourself lost in the woods and nice reflective patches that glowed under the street lamps when you made your daily walk to the bus stop. I had become very attached to this backpack over the years, not just because of its physical attributes, but also because it remained the only reliable thing in my life. This backpack was there for me when I got bullied by the mean boys on the back of the bus for not being good enough, it was there when I had rushed to the hospital after school to find that my younger sibling was diagnosed with brain cancer, it was there when I started high school, it was there when I had lunch alone in the bathroom stalls, it was there when I threw up on the kid in front of me's head waiting in line, and it was there for so many tiny, but life-defining experiences. Though a month and a half ago as I was walking, I felt something round hit the back of my leg. I looked down and found the mandarin orange I had thrown in my backpack earlier that morning. After further inspection, I was distraught to find a big, threads hanging, completely irreparable hole at the bottom of my backpack. I called customer service, then the store I had bought it from, only to find that there was nothing I could do. My backpack couldn't be saved and I would have to finish the last 3 months of highschool using a tote bag or whatever else I could find. I had hoped to end my academic journey thus far with this backpack, do the kind of symbolic send-off that only happens in feel-good paperbacks. Three days later school was canceled because of COVID-19, and two days ago I was informed that school would be closed for the end of the year, marking the official end of my high school career. I just found it kind of oddly sweet, a little nod from the universe, the "death" of my backpack almost directly coincided with the "death" of highschool for me (and for all of us). I don't know if I'm reaching and maybe it's just a simple coincidence, but I just felt compelled to share the nice story of my oracle backpack amidst everything that's going on. I hope everyone's doing well :)

Edit: wow I did not expect my first ever post on reddit to get so many positive comments, you make my heart warm <3 you guys are all so sweet and wonderful and I could not have gotten into college without your help. I'll miss you all! (even though all I did was lurk). icons! all of you.

Yesterday was grad practice and cap and gown pick up for seniors. About an hour after the event ended I got a text from my sister saying she never made it to school since the cab failed to come get her smh. Since graduation is on Sunday and school isn't opened during the weekend, there wouldn't be any other way for her to get her cap and gown unless I went down to get them. I kindly offered my idea to fetch her graduation materials by pretending to be her.
Many people say we look the exact same so I thought it would be a fool proof idea. Indeed it was.

Now I thought this entire process would take about 5 minutes but it ended up being 15 minutes instead. There was some difficulty finding where the school stored everything once practice was over. I was hopping all over the school as I kept getting redirected to different places. While waiting for the admin to figure out where the remaining caps and gowns were stored, a company rep was fitting me into extras in case they couldn't find them.
I was grinning the entire time knowing I wore a gown before my own senior sister. Although to the rep I probably looked like some giddy senior lmao. Admin came back not too long after and told me where "my" ordered cap and gown was. Went down to destination, picked up my sister's cap and gown and her academic honor materials, then went back to class. What a day.

[Check the trailer out here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mVcmuqWNQ4&feature=youtu.be)

And sign up for news and/or to be a beta tester [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9zS6YmHAOjW7ub-mnqEsW2p1kR5JlVk6YzxNG0oK2igA41g/viewform)!

After many months, my friends and I are proud to present a preview of our upcoming game: "Admission Revolutionnaire!" All the writing, voice acting, music comp, and programming is by us. We've been working on this project as a sort of "last hurrah!" before we all part ways for college. It's our way of giving back and saying thanks to the a2c community for all the laughs and guidance over the last \~2 years. I've been a frequent (like x3 / day / every day obsessive) lurker, and I really owe my entire understanding of the application process to you guys. So thank you for being part of this community and making it the ü§°y place it is.

So..... what is *Admission Revolutionnaire*? It's what happens when you mash a dating sim with Ace Attorney, sprinkle a little bit of Majora's Mask on top, and resolutely adhere to your theme of making  an "admissions" based game.

\- The game begins Dec. 31. You have 72 hours to apply to all of your colleges! Luckily, your high school counsellor negotiated a special deal with the Elite Admission Officers. They‚Äôre letting you do 3 days of interviews *instead* of supplements!

\- The Elite Admission Officers are personifications of T20 colleges. Win them over by answering their questions favorably! Increase your chances of getting accepted to their school.

\- **Yale interview dating sim!!!**

\- Investigate the USC admissions scandal! With Paul Ledesma's help, you'll surely blow it wide open.

\- Cleaning your room before recording your Brown video interview minigame.

\- Spreadsheet-creating action. Portal link organizing.

\- A look into the life of CMC and her 4 twin sisters.

\- Last minute scrambling to get Princeton their graded paper.

\- "Why does Columbia want NO context for why I love 'The Perils of Windmills In the Modern World'?"

\- Sit down with your AO and determine which hospitals are your viables and which are your reaches

\- Freaking out when you accidentally send Harvard a pdf that opens, "Congratulations, your computer is equipped with a PDF (Portable Document Format) reader!" instead of your real supplement.

\- And so much more!!! (including an original soundtrack and voice acting!)

If interested, to keep current with game updates, put in your email or phone number [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9zS6YmHAOjW7ub-mnqEsW2p1kR5JlVk6YzxNG0oK2igA41g/viewform) and I'll  send you a message when there's news.

I really hope you guys enjoy this preview and my friends and I can't wait to share more in the future. If there's enough interest, we might launch a Kickstarter to help realize features we've conceptualized that aren't currently feasible... one of us just needs to be 18 first (which happens in about a week)!

Anyways, good luck over the next two weeks everyone! No matter where you all end up, I'm sure you'll do great! Thanks for making this subreddit so awesome. =)

Edit: Btw, since a handful of artists reached out -- yes, it'd be awesome to have some more artists on the team! Send me a Reddit DM if you might be interested!

Also, if you enjoyed, please consider retweeting on [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/AdmissionRevol1/status/1239238303561306112) Hoping to spread the word there too. :P

## [PSA for fellow males: Check if your country of origin or citizenship practices conscription](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cd8d7y/psa_for_fellow_males_check_if_your_country_of/)
[Map here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg)

If you hold a citizenship in any of these countries, you may be legally obligated to perform military service. In some countries, you will have no other option, while some will offer alternate service.

As someone who has looked into this matter extensively, I can offer some tips. These are not universal, and I am not and have never been a conscript. Your experience will differ from country to country.

1st. This is not a light matter. People have died from hazing, stress, and accidents (Korea and Russia being prime examples). You are not going off to summer camp. These programs do not care about you. They are built to create a large fighting reserve, and will use you however they wish.

2nd. You will be severely hampered in your future plans. Most conscripts will not be able to leave their base for extended periods of time, and you will usually be cut off from the rest of the world. 2 years might not sound long, but it is in fact 2.5% of your life gone. And that 2.5% is in your prime.

3rd. The world will not stop when you are gone. Your friends will have made newer friends and had newer experiences. Popular culture will have shifted. New shows, movies, and books will have come out. No one will bend over backwards to accommodate you, beyond allowing you to return to some version of your previous life.

4th. You will be broken down. To me, the shaving of hair is an extremely symbolic act. When I was young and in India, my hair was cut short to impose upon me a sense of uniformity, and strip from me parts of my individuality. Not only will you most likely be shaved, you will be drilled and taught to conform to team dynamics. You will be instilled with a sense of detachment from your personal beliefs.

5th. You will not be paid well. You will also most likely not receive any benefits. This is not the US military. If you have some fanciful idea of service with civilians saluting you as you collect your regular benefits and enjoy a prestigious post in life, get that idea out of your head. Being fair, you will be provided accommodation and food, but don‚Äôt expect either to be particularly good.

6th. There is no equality (unless you are in Norway or, to a lesser degree, Israel). Don‚Äôt expect to see women serving alongside you. You will be expected to give up these years of your life for the sole virtue of being born male. They do not care for equality. If you complain about it, you will be ridiculed.

Here is my recommendation:

Humans are not made to be turned into cannon fodder. They should not be herded or forced to potentially kill. They should not be tasked with laying down their lives for the rest of society. They should not be subject to harsh conditions and used as slave labor. Their individuality should be respected. Discipline and sense of belonging are neither guaranteed nor always desirable.

If you have any legal avenue of leaving the country and renouncing your citizenship, do it. Life expectancy is not a guarantee. You do not know if you will be alive for the next sixty years. If you die in three years, do you really want to have spent two in the bone chilling cold, shoveling snow?

Many of these countries will allow you to defer service if you are in higher education. Countries such as Canada and New Zealand are known for giving preference for permanent residence to those who graduated from domestic universities.

If you have religious beliefs, you might even try applying for refugee status. Certain communities, such as Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, have been known to be targets of such systems despite their refusal to serve in any military capacity. Reach out to religious organizations and they might be able to help. For atheists, you can also try to look for pacifist organizations that might support you due to their opposition to war.

If you are in the US, you have most likely registered for Selective Service. While the draft has not been active in 4 decades, males aged 18-26 have to register. If you are already 18, make sure you register or you may be ineligible for federal benefits and may be fined for $250,000. Prosecution is uncommon, but do not risk it. Furthermore, write to your Congressman to support either the abolishment of Selective Service or extend it to women on equal terms.

I am not a lawyer. I am not a legal expert. I am not advising you to commit any hasty action. I am simply raising awareness of the matter. Your life is yours. Please never forget that.

It‚Äôs disheartening. They told me it seemed like I slacked off in high school, and that that‚Äôs why I achieved ‚Äúlow levels of success.‚Äù

Come on dawg. I just want people to know that the college process doesn‚Äôt HAVE TO BE HELL. It can be managed well. But some people just cannot handle me posting about how I got into good schools without stress, just bc I didn‚Äôt get into top 10 schools.

I only bring it forward because their comments got an upsetting number of likes.

I don‚Äôt care if you want to go to a top tier school, I really don‚Äôt, but come ON. I was just trying to give advice to those who find themselves stressing about the process, it was so uncalled for.

#Part 7:  How To End An Essay Gracefully

Ending essays is hard, and most students struggle to end their essay elegantly.  Mistakes here can linger in the reviewer's mind and really bring down what might have otherwise been a strong essay.  They often seem to end:

**1.  Abruptly as if the word count snuck up on them** and tackled them from behind just as they were drawing a breath to continue.  Sometimes this is actually what happened and the student didn't edit very well (if this is you, see Part 5 linked above).

**2.  By simply rehashing something that was already stated** ‚Äì a casualty of the common yet misguided advice to make your point thrice over in your introduction, body, and conclusion.  Other times students turn to their academic BSing skills and just say the same things a slightly different way to fill out the word count.  If this sounds familiar, see Part 6 linked above.

**3.  With a trite aphorism or sweeping generality.**  Examples include phrases such as "striving to achieve our full potential," "making the world a better place," etc.  These are commonplace and lame, but worse, they say nothing about the student.  Instead, they make the AO instantly aware that the author is trying to make an impression with such a statement and it causes skepticism about the sincerity of everything they just read.

#So how do you end an essay in a compelling and purposeful way?

Obviously you want to give the sense that the essay actually ended intentionally rather than being stifled by the word count or trailing off into awkward silence.  You also want to leave a final good impression.  You need to close gracefully, sincerely, and purposefully so they continue to feel positively about you and reward you with a top score.  Here are a few ideas - there are more in the full guide available on my site.  I'd love to hear any others you have in the comments.

#The Comedian's Call Back

I'm fond of the "call back" commonly used by comedians (see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(comedy)). You reference something from earlier in your essay to say one more thing about yourself. Sometimes this is something that you used to start the essay off. Other times it's something that was a major theme of the essay, a big part of the story you told, or a salient insight or twist on something you mentioned before.

#The Interchapter

Another option is to depart from the story and inject something more about you. Examples of this in literature include the socialist meeting Jurgis stumbles upon at the end of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and John Galt's speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged.  You obviously don't have the space to elaborate here, so one or two sentences is probably enough.  You will want to work in a smooth transition though so it doesn't feel jilted or like it "breaks the fourth wall."  One example of a good way to do this is to end with a quote about you spoken by one of the characters in your story.

However you choose to end, try to show depth of thought, introspection, maturity, and humility.  Just like great stories, when you do this right, the AO finishes the essay wishing it had continued longer.  They want to know more about you and are intrigued by the personality you presented.

## [A (Mostly) Rational Argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e6szia/a_mostly_rational_argument/)
Update: Rejected. But when one door closes, another opens.

Ok so I applied to Stanford REA, and, as the decisions come out tomorrow, I'm actively trying to digest the butterflies swarming in my stomach. All of my friends are applying to Ivies either EA or ED, and anxiety is HIGH at my school. So, here's my thinking, if you'll bear with me.

Earlier this year, I heard about a really interesting study that was done on two unique groups of people: people that had recently become paralyzed, and people that had recently won the lottery. As expected, the Lottery People (LP) were very happy, and the Paralyzed People (PP) were comparatively not. However, when these people were evaluated 1, 2, and 3 years later, both the PP and LP exhibited VERY SIMILAR levels of happiness.

So, what does this mean in the context of my favorite Reddit forum, A2C? Well, you can take it to mean whatever you want, but here's my rationalization: tomorrow at 7 pm, when I clear the textbooks off my desk, and sit down with my computer to check Stanford admissions, one of three distinct options will occur (deferral, rejection, acceptance). I'm really hoping for the big W, but realistic. (What's the acceptance, like 9 percent early and 3 percent regular decision? Geez) But regardless, whether I am crushed and paralyzed by the metaphorical "rejection bus," or get lucky in the "acceptance lottery," in 1, 2, or 3 years, I'll be just as happy either way.

College acceptance is not our worth. College acceptance is not our value. College acceptance is not a reflection of our character, intelligence, or aptitude. And most importantly, college acceptance is not going to determine our happiness. Good luck to everyone, and see you at 7 tomorrow.

## [See you later, r/ApplyingToCollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e9ygy2/see_you_later_rapplyingtocollege/)
Ever since my freshman year, I‚Äôve spent countless all-nighters browsing this subreddit. At the time, I was an apathetic student who just smoked weed and took *gag* regular classes. However, as my grades began to slip and competition at my school ramped up, I knew that I would have to make a change. It seemed so far off at the time, and yet getting into college was something that I was determined to achieve.

AP courses, SAT Subject Tests, Common App essays ‚Äî this subreddit taught me everything that had to be done to stand apart. Reading casual mentions of a 36 ACT or a passing murmur of a 4.7 GPA motivated me to try hard in the most challenging classes my school offers. I researched schools, submitted copious Chance-Me‚Äôs, and read through each comment on past decision day mega threads.

December 12, 2019.

As I approached D-day, I was nervous. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure I got rejected,‚Äù I told all my friends at school. As I opened the applicant portal to view my decision at 3:00 PM PST, I hesitated for a second. Was I mentally prepared to be rejected? Of course, I had come to peace with that outcome weeks ago. Deferred? Hopefully not. I much rather get rejected now than later. Accepted? Don‚Äôt have to worry about her. With the knowledge that I was prepared to receive my rejection, I pressed on.

‚ÄúCongratulations! I am delighted to inform you that you have been admitted to Brown University‚Äôs Class of 2024.‚Äù

## [Prestige changes people...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gjv9um/prestige_changes_people/)
Long story short, I was accepted to a top university. It‚Äôs the first time this has happened in my area so everyone was pretty impressed.

However, going through high school I was never really liked by most of my teachers. I worked hard but they didn‚Äôt like me due to my family connections. Both my mom and sister went to the same high school I did, and they both had mental disabilities that made them difficult for the school to deal with. This meant that they were a hassle to teach, and therefore not liked by the faculty. This ended up also applying to me as I went through high school. Even if I did well, I didn‚Äôt have the right last name and often got kicked to the side.

Now that I‚Äôve been accepted into a nice school, everybody likes me now. My old teachers who unfairly graded me and refused to recommend me or nominate me for school positions are now friending me on facebook, making posts about how they‚Äôre so proud of me and that they are honored to have taught me, and sending me personal messages of how they are glad they helped me in my journey. They‚Äôre talking to my mom, who they once treated so poorly, about how proud they are of her and me both. She knows it‚Äôs all lies and attempts to take credit for me.

These teachers did the bare minimum to help me, and now it pisses me off that they‚Äôre trying to take credit for the success I‚Äôve had that they tried so hard to keep me from. I hate all of it. I was always teased at my school by the principals and guidance counselor for applying to big schools. They would always mock me or say I was wasting my money. And now that I‚Äôve actually done something, they‚Äôre so excited to post me on facebook and brag about me on senior day.

Sure, I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve gotten this far, but I hate that everyone is trying to take credit for my own doing.

## [Don‚Äôt talk bad about someone who got into a school you didn‚Äôt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f1ao3n/dont_talk_bad_about_someone_who_got_into_a_school/)
Now I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get into Northeastern and after hearing that some of the smartest kids in my grade got deferred and rejected, I was definitely a little dismayed. But I got in. I guess I did go through what is called ‚Äúimposter syndrome‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt believe I belong or deserved to go. However, after I realized that this process is very detailed and realized that they wanted me then I started to feel better. I actually felt bad for those who didn‚Äôt get in because I think everyone has something to bring.

But now I‚Äôm just angry.

I‚Äôm my opinion, you don‚Äôt need to try to bring others down just because you didn‚Äôt get in. Like don‚Äôt talk shit about me just because you didn‚Äôt get in, what good what it serve to you. Like it‚Äôs just annoying because I didn‚Äôt say anything to anyone, I was actually very considerate of celebrating because I know those who got rejected could possibly see.

Sorry for the rant.

*edit*

I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù or ‚Äúweak‚Äù or whatever you edgy kids who think being rude is a personality trait claim. Frankly I could care less, considering the person isn‚Äôt even saying it to my face. What I am saying is why demean someone you know nothing about in a process that isn‚Äôt completely up to you. Just move on like other people do. You have every right to be upset, but you don‚Äôt have a right to demean and be be rude to someone else.

## [Can we all agree this all sucks ??](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fjqzzv/can_we_all_agree_this_all_sucks/)
Yes, it sucks that seniors are getting their grad nights, admission days, proms, possible graduation, last senior performances, games, events cancelled. Sucks major ass.

Yes, it sucks that juniors are getting their SATS and competitions and AP tests cancelled or interferes with.

Yes, if sucks for the underclassmen who are gonna be missing out on valuable time to volunteer or participate in activities.

Yes, it sucks for college students who are possibly having their own senior events cancelled maybe even graduation.

Yes, it sucks for the adults who won‚Äôt be able to work and will get behind on payments.

Yes, it sucks for the people who actually have the disease and their health is in jeapordy.

So can we stop saying ‚Äúokay but MY junior year is messed up so stop complaining‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôll my senior events are cancelled so I have it worse‚Äù. It all sucks. And if you want to vent about how much it sucks, go for it! This is an open space! But don‚Äôt make this into a competition about who has it worse. This all sucks and sometimes we just need to vent.

Life will go on and this pandemic will pass and we‚Äôll be okay. Let‚Äôs not make this ugly guys. We‚Äôre better than that.

The title says it all. I was always the kid who people wanted to be acquainted with, but not necessarily included in any friend groups. I'm the "smart kid" who people only really want to talk to when they need help with homework or want me to be in their group when it comes to doing group projects so they don't have to do much of the work. I just can't wait to go to college and be surrounded by people who think like me and would gladly want to be friends. Anyone else?

Alright so basically what I‚Äôve noticed about people who get into top schools that I‚Äôve been friends with is that they‚Äôre all nice people and actually have a life. If you have to study 24/7 and don‚Äôt have time for a social life just to maintain good grades and good test scores, you don‚Äôt belong at a top school. The people who belong at t20s are the people who actually have a life and passions beyond ‚ÄòI need a 4.0 GPA and 36 ACT‚Äô they‚Äôre just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that. Y‚Äôall really need to chill because frankly not having a life is ruining your chances. When you look back and think ‚Äòwhy did I get deferred/denied? I had a 4.0, I studied every single hour, I joined 7 different ECs just for this college‚Äô then that is exactly why you got deferred/denied. Sure, there are some exceptions. But colleges don‚Äôt want people with no outside competence and no perspective which so many of you display them wonder why you‚Äôre not getting in to your top choices.

Edit: just because you didn‚Äôt get into a top school doesn‚Äôt mean that you necessarily have no personality! Top schools are always hard, getting rejected even with good scores could be a lot of reasons

Edit2:  I‚Äôm apologize to any 1 specific person who read this and got upset. I am sure you have a life. I never tried to say that you didn‚Äôt, you can have exactly 7 ECs but still have a life. The number was arbitrary, I didn‚Äôt mean to offend anyone with the post it was just my opinion.

## [Unpopular opinion: I‚Äôm happy that the rest of my senior year was cancelled.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gclsgk/unpopular_opinion_im_happy_that_the_rest_of_my/)
Now I‚Äôm by no means saying that I‚Äôm happy this whole corona situation happened. It‚Äôs awful that people have died and suffered from this disease. It‚Äôs awful that people lost their jobs and loved ones. And I‚Äôm definitely sad about the possibility of my freshman year of college being ruined.

However, I was done with high school. Senior year especially. I had overloaded myself with 6 APs and two leadership positions that were taking a toll on me. My grades were slipping. I was at school from 8am-4pm then spent 4 hours after school four days a week going to tutoring because my grades were slipping. Then I went home and did more homework/studying. Then I got like 3 hours worth of sleep, woke up, and did the whole thing over again. I was exhausted.

I was on the breaking point. I didn‚Äôt have time to take care of myself, to eat properly, I was drinking 3 cups of coffee/energy drinks a day, I had no time for my friends or hobbies that I enjoyed. So when it was announced that school was cancelled, I was super relieved. That endless cycle was over.

I‚Äôve been catching up on sleep, cooking healthy meals for myself, catching up on tv that I enjoy, talking to my friends on the phone, spending lots of quality time with my dog, and taking care of myself. I don‚Äôt mind that I have to give up prom and graduation. I don‚Äôt see it as ‚Äúnot getting recognition for the past four years‚Äù or something valuable taken away from me. I was miserable throughout all of high school anyway and a dance and a long ass ceremony wasn‚Äôt going to fix that.

I don‚Äôt know if I could‚Äôve lasted 3 more months doing what I was doing. I probably would‚Äôve broken down at some point. But now that I‚Äôm at home with lots of time to myself, I can rest and rejuvenate. So yeah, this whole situation does suck. But I‚Äôm secretly thankful.

I do feel bad for people who were genuinely looking forward to senior activities though. I hope you‚Äôre able to find some solace through these tough times. Just know that better times await us.

*But, if you do happen to find something that‚Äôs driving you crazy or that really must be fixed, read from the college how to best update your application ‚Äî usually it‚Äôs on the portal or by email ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to read the specific directions from each school. Don‚Äôt panic ‚Äî they know mistakes happen. They happen every year.

*It‚Äôs time to let those baby apps fly! Even the early ones. You‚Äôve poured your heart and soul into bringing them about and nurtured them, now you have to let them go do their thing and make you proud.

Even after all your apps are in, though, you need to be sure you're covering a few things. Here's a list to keep up with what happens next.

Be sure to:

1. Look for emails from your colleges with directions how to create your portals and create them. Be sure to check the spam and junk folders.

2. Make your accounts and log into the portals. Check to see what's missing - but know if can take up to a week for materials to upload.

3. Make sure your supplement was submitted on the Common App. It can sometimes be left behind the way that some colleges have it organized on the Common App.

4. Send any test scores that still need to be sent to your other colleges.  Don't wait until the deadlines. Test scores can be sent before the application.

5. Follow up with your teacher recommenders and see if they need anything from you to facilitate sending letters if they haven't yet done so.

6. Write thank you notes to your recommenders. They aren't paid extra and it's usually not included in their job descriptions. They do it to help you.

7. Check all your portals from your colleges regularly to make sure they're not missing anything. That's how they will communicate with you.

8. Check your junk mail  and spam inboxes often to be on the lookout for messages from colleges and interviewers.  If you‚Äôre looking for interview thoughts and advice, you can find [my interview post here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dsmq3r/your_step_by_step_guide_to_college_interviews/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

9. Check your voicemail and texts to be on the lookout for messages from interviewers. Make sure voicemail is set up and the message is appropriate.

10. Follow up with your high school counselor to make sure that all is good there and that y'all are on the same page and you've done everything they're expecting of you.

11. Make sure your Naviance list is complete and updated if your school uses Naviance.

12. Consider reaching out to your regional admissions officers at the colleges where you're applying to say hello and introduce yourself and ask any questions you might have. It‚Äôs ok to reach out to them with questions you can‚Äôt easily find via google or on the website.

12. Open every email from all the colleges where you've applied, and click on all the links. This is where they will share important info about your application with you.

13. Take some time to breathe, recharge batteries, get outside, read a book, do yoga, have a dance party in your room or meditate!!

14. One more thing ‚Äî Vote this week üá∫üá∏ ‚Äî if you live in the US and you‚Äôre at least 18, it‚Äôs your responsibility. The future of our country depends on you.

15. BREATHE. You did a great job and you‚Äôre now officially an early app badass!

tl;dr:  It‚Äôs important info. You need to read it. üòä

It says on the page it is a damn electronic report. Why do I have to pay if they're basically sending a fucking email to the school with my stupid scores that I already paid $50+ for each of them? WHY TF DO THEY NEED 14 BUSINESS DAYS TO SEND A STUPID ELECTRONIC REPORT? IS THERE FUCKIGN TRAFFIC ON THE INTERNET OR SOMETHING? FUck. Also Fuck schools that don't allow you to self report. Honestly I should put "entering my credit card details on college boards website" as an ec on my common app. FUcK.

GOSH DANG IT KIDS this is going to sound like a rant but I PROMISE I‚Äôm trying to help you out here.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a 36 ACT and a perfect GPA. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you cured cancer and fed the homeless by hand for eleven years straight. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your parents are billionaires and your hamster has his own diamond studded Tesla. You are guaranteed NOTHING in the college admissions process.

I see so many people on this sub reeling after getting their decisions back because their ‚Äúsafety schools‚Äù were schools like Vanderbilt and Rice. Just because they have the lowest averages of everywhere you applied DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN BE YOUR SAFETY. THEY ARE NO ONES SAFETY. THEY COULD RARELY BE CONSIDERED A MATCH FOR ANYONE. It hurts so badly to be left with only a few choices after the whole process is over, or worse yet, to only have one choice or god forbid none at all. A certain degree of confidence is needed to apply to all these top schools but please don‚Äôt let that cloud your judgement. You are guaranteed nothing in these situations, no matter how perfect a candidate you are.

Choose a safety you like, but first and foremost make sure your SAFETY is a school you are ACTUALLY 99.9% confident you can get into. I‚Äôm not making this post to put anyone down it‚Äôs just that this seems to be a way too common mistake that isn‚Äôt getting addressed loudly enough for it to be clear.

Tl;dr- Make sure your safeties are actually safeties

## [If you‚Äôre writing an essay about overcoming an obstacle, write it about an actual obstacle](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmtnbm/if_youre_writing_an_essay_about_overcoming_an/)
Yes, everyone goes through a hard time in our life and it‚Äôs not right to diminish them. However, this is the instance I‚Äôm writing this post off of.

I know a kid who was applying for college a few years ago. She was extremely involved in her community, did lots of service, etc. so she had quite a bit to write about. However, she decided to write her common app on the most difficult thing she‚Äôs ever expedited - AP Physics I. I read the essay and the only came off as super entitled. She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI struggled so much my grade slipped to an A- and my parents had to hire a private tutor. Ugh.‚Äù She actually could have written a pretty humorous essay about AP Physics or talked about how the prompt made her realize how lucky she was.

Like I said, I‚Äôm not saying that your obstacle is invalid. However, if you can‚Äôt think of one that you can write a really great essay on, just choose a different prompt (if you can). If you can‚Äôt, put an interesting spin on it. For example, if the number one obstacle you‚Äôve had to overcome is losing luggage on a trip to Europe, maybe write how that gave you the opportunity to visit local, non-tourist shops and got to connect with people and places that you haven‚Äôt previously gotten to and you would like to have a similar opportunity through a study abroad trip one day.

Edit: I was scrolling threw twitter and found an interesting [thread](https://twitter.com/aoifeamcgowan/status/1262650110820995072?s=21)  about how a lot of times when students write college essays they feel like they‚Äôre obligated to talk about their trauma/obstacle. Mentally, this can be really bad for students and cause mental health issues since these often repressed memories are being resurfaced.

## [Congratulations to the Class of 2020!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gbnf6e/congratulations_to_the_class_of_2020/)
Congratulations, class of 2020!

It‚Äôs finally here ‚Äî May 1st, National Decision Day. I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but it feels like it‚Äôs been forever since I last saw confetti popping up on my Common App after I submitted my applications. We all spent late nights studying, procrastinated on our college essays, anxiously opened our decision letters, and all the while, posted some great memes about this complicated process. But today is the culmination of all that, when we finally decide where and how we‚Äôll be spending these next four years.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that our senior years have to end like this, and for all of the missed senior trips, proms, graduations, skip-days, and other traditions, I‚Äôm truly, truly sorry. However, I think we ought to appreciate the fact that we‚Äôve had four whole years of amazing experiences with even more amazing people, and that we‚Äôve created memories to share and reflect upon for a lifetime. While this is a bittersweet conclusion to our high school years, it‚Äôs certainly only the beginning for what‚Äôs to come.

Whether you were satisfied with your decisions this admissions season or not, I cannot stress this enough. Your college experience will be defined by how you take advantage of the opportunities and resources that lie before you, not by the college that you attend or by the rankings with which they are associated. With consistent effort, diligence, and ambition, all of our desires and aspirations are within our grasp.

I‚Äôm beyond proud to see the class of 2020‚Äôs tremendous achievements, and I‚Äôm so grateful for the supportive, collaborative environment that we‚Äôve cultivated here in this community. While I encourage everyone to stay on A2C and lend a helping hand to the incoming senior class, I understand that this will also be a final goodbye to many of you.¬†We‚Äôre all in this together!

Feel free to comment below where you‚Äôve committed, and please make sure to fill out the [2020 A2C Census](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g9ci9q/the_2020_ra2c_census/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

## [If you were thinking about cheating or lying in your college application, this isn't the year to do it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bzdtle/if_you_were_thinking_about_cheating_or_lying_in/)
I've seen several people on this sub and elsewhere struggling with the temptation to lie on their application or with how to handle someone else who did.  The recent admission scandals have shown more clearly than ever how this can go horribly wrong.  Most people here are probably familiar with those, but this isn't a new problem.  Let's look at some other examples and analyze this question.

1.  [Here's a story in the NYT from 2008 of a kid who lied to get in to Yale.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/education/10yale.html)  He ended up getting kicked out of Yale and charged with grand larceny, forgery, and other crimes by the state of Connecticut.

2.  [Here's the account of Adam Wheeler, who was kicked out of Harvard for lying on his application and found guilty of 20 different charges of fraud, larceny, and falsification.](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/12/16/harvard-wheeler-college-guilty/?page=single).  Wheeler was sentenced to 2.5 years in jail, 10 years probation, and ordered to repay $45K in grants and aid, *even though he never personally received the money.*

3.  [Here's a Time Magazine story](http://nation.time.com/2013/10/17/seven-shocking-college-admissions-scandals/) of 7 different college admissions scandals.  Kids who cheated on the SAT got kicked out of school and charged with felonies.  Kid caught lying on his Harvard app got kicked out.

4.  [Here's a Reddit post of a guy who lied and cheated to get in to a top school and got away with it](https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1xvahj/need_advice_i_blatantly_lied_all_over_my_college/).  Except most of the post is about how torn up he is over it, how he feels like his life is ruined, how he wants to come clean even if it means getting expelled, and how it pushed him to drug use that has become problematic and debilitating.

But how will you get caught?  According to the IvyCoach blog, "Some universities such as MIT actually check up on a random selection of applicants to ensure that what they put on their application is the truth. They do this in the hope of not only deterring people from lying but in the hope of catching applicants once they lie so that these students will not become members of their incoming class of admitted students."

From the CollegeWise admissions blog:

>"Colleges know how to spot inconsistencies in your application.  They notice when things you say don't match with what your teachers or counselors say in the letters of recommendation.  And colleges won't hesitate to call your counselor to verify information that doesn't seem right.  They don't do it to catch you in a lie.  They do it to make sure they have accurate information.

>So sure, it's possible that you could claim to be a National Merit finalist and the college would never know.  You could claim to have played two years of varsity soccer when you only played one, that you did 50 hours of community service you didn't really do, or that you've never been suspended from school when, in fact, you were suspended once as a freshman.  A college might never find out.

>But the real question is, is it worth the risk?

>If you lie on your college application and a college finds out‚Äìno matter what the lie is or how they find out‚Äìthat's it.  You're not getting in.  And it wouldn't be unheard of for colleges to tell your other colleges what you did.  Colleges know that kids who are willing to take that risk are more likely to do things like cheat on a test or plagiarize a paper.  So the risk dramatically outweighs any potential reward.  And when you sign your college application, you're signing a formal document stating that all of the information is true to the best of your knowledge.  So if you get caught, forget it.  There will be no apologizing your way out of it."

Numerous college admissions websites and other sources on Reddit and elsewhere corroborate that colleges can deny you, impact your admission elsewhere, kick you out, **or even cancel your degree after you graduate** if they find out you lied to get in.  They can also press charges or sue to reclaim scholarships or other aid you got illegally.  Remember that if you lie to get in and accept ANY financial aid, you are *stealing that money*.  Are you sure you want to steal a 5 or 6 figure sum?

If you're aware of someone else who is committing financial aid fraud, [here's a post on how to handle and report that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/asptha/how_to_handle_and_report_financial_aid_fraud/)

As a specific example, Harvard's admissions site has their application integrity policy spelled out:

>"MISREPRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS

>Be completely accurate in your application materials. If we discover a misrepresentation during the admissions process, you will be denied admission. If you have already been admitted, your offer will typically be withdrawn. If you have already registered, your admission will normally be revoked, and we will require you to leave the College. Harvard rescinds degrees if misrepresentations in application materials are discovered.

>The determination that an application is inaccurate or contains misrepresentations rests solely with the Admissions Office and will be resolved outside the student disciplinary process."

Note that the admissions office has full power (judge, jury, & executioner).  Penn's Dean of Admissions once famously quipped, "With an eight percent admit rate if we‚Äôre not quite sure about something, guess what, we don‚Äôt have to take the risk."  The big frauds are the ones you hear about and make the news. You'll never know about the otherwise qualified applicant who stretched the truth a little and just got denied for it. Some of those outstanding applicants who post sob stories on College Confidential where they went 0-10 could be because they lied, got caught, and then got rejected across the board for it. You can't ever know for sure that you won't get caught.

I've seen people on this sub consider lying about URM status, but that's a bad idea too.  There are sometimes follow up questions when it comes to more rare URMs like Native American. They might want to know what tribe you're registered with or ancestral line you're from. They have ways of checking up on stuff like this, such as ensuring that your application matches the information your high school has on record for you.  If none of your essays, ECs, recommendations, etc have any "cultural flavor" the URM impact is significantly diminished anyway.  Do you really think you can fake your entire culture and never get caught?

Here's another way to think about it. There are actual organizations in some parts of the world which go through Mission-Impossible-like schemes to obtain a test bank for an upcoming standardized test. Once they get one, students (or sometimes people hired impersonate the student) study the stolen bank for weeks to ensure they can get a perfect score. If getting an edge was as easy as simply checking a different box, exaggerating service hours, or fabricating some leadership, why would they go through all that effort? Do you think you're the first 17 year old to envision such a *brilliant* idea, or even the first your AO encounters *this month*?

There are documented cases of students lying about less significant things and getting kicked out of school later. For example I heard of a guy who said he had a disability/injury so he could get an accessible (and much larger) dorm room. When he was discovered, he was kicked out of school.

There are many other prominent examples of people losing a great opportunity because they lied about something. Go look up why George O'Leary is not the head football coach at Notre Dame.  Even in cases like Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon the biggest problem was not their actual indiscretions - it was the fact that they lied about them.  The current admissions scandal that is still in courts is just another example of how big and how bad this can get.

UCLA includes the following statement in one of their admission guides:

>"UCLA expects an application to be the work of the student and any deviation that violates University policy may lead to rejection of application materials, revocation of an admission offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the University. There is no formula for gaining admission to UCLA. Students with vastly different credentials come from thousands of secondary schools across the country and around the world. What unifies our students are the talents they bring to UCLA and their passion to explore all that UCLA has to offer."

It is certainly true that admissions offices do not have time to verify every detail of every application, however as Penn Dean of Admissions Eric Furda once famously quipped, "With an eight percent admit rate if we‚Äôre not quite sure about something, guess what, we don‚Äôt have to take the risk."

Here is the bottom line.  If you're only going to stretch the truth a little bit, sure you will likely get away with it.  But the risk is still there and the benefit is very marginal.  The more you lie, the more likely it is that you will get caught.  Just be honest, and be yourself.

TL;DR - No, you shouldn't lie.  If you're thinking about it, please read the post and reconsider.

## [Fu*ck you Lehigh. You are an asshole.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edgr7z/fuck_you_lehigh_you_are_an_asshole/)
I called Lehigh after that incident (https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ed4jff/what_the_fuk_lehigh_how_can_you_do_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). The admission office told me that they were sorry. I elaborated them my situation and how hard it has been for me now.

The lady noted my phone number and said that I will soon get a call from someone at Lehigh. The time was around ( 8:30 am in Lehigh). I waited for the call for 3 hours but got no response. I called them again, and she said that the respective official is in the different call. "Oh, okay", I said.

Then I called them, again and again, and she said the same thing. I called them again, and again the same thing. And slowly they didn't even receive the call

I made my last call at 4:45 pm in Lehigh. I didn't sleep for the whole night. I repeatedly made call for "8" hours. Now when I call again, and it says that business hours are over and to make a call on Monday.

So they played with me? I will never forgive them for this and will not call them again. I pray for their demise. Such an asshole institution.

P.S: Thanks to all A2C member who consoled me in a hard time. Now I'll not look back at that fucking college. I'll move on. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Edit: They called me by themselves just now and said that they are ready to offer me any help and i should look forward apply to other colleges. They were ready to provide me admission but since financial aid budget is out, they couldn't. And if i could pay the full cost now, they will accept me.

And I'll obviously not pay anything more than my previous EFC. Looking forward now. Thanks guys.

## [BREAKING NEWS: Northeastern University decides to just not do decisions this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fp1o6k/breaking_news_northeastern_university_decides_to/)
In a truly unprecedented move, Northeastern University has decided to not bother finishing to read their remaining Regular Decision applications and revoke admission from all those accepted in the early rounds.

"We deeply regret to inform all our potential applicants that we will no longer be able to send them short, impersonal letters this year." noted Assistant Dean of Admissions Stefanie Kane. "It was lots of fun sending them confusing and vague emails about our decision date, though. The funniest part? We weren't releasing decisions in the first place this year!" Kane also scoffed at the idea of institutional oversight and transparency. "We only hope our decisions release process is as nonsensical and sporadic as the University of Michigan's. The website crash in January simply wasn't enough."

Experts suggest that the move may have been an effort by Northeastern to manage their yield and US News ranking. "If you don't accept anyone, your yield rate automatically rises to 100%." noted many high school seniors disguised as college admissions experts. Additionally, Northeastern's ranking is projected to rise significantly next year, making it competitive with similarly named institutions such as Northwestern, the South Eastern Conference, and Southwestern Missouri Community College.

Many A2C members were at first inconsolable, but soon realized that they didn't want to "fuckin attend a school named after a direction anyways" and it was all "yield protection".

EDIT: Thanks for the awards!

Seeing others (who aren‚Äôt as serious about school) getting accepted into schools I really wanted to get into is hard to deal with. Of course I support them but there‚Äôs something in the back of my head that makes me feel like shit. Especially since I watched them fool around for most of high school while I stayed back working my ass off. And the funny thing is that I‚Äôm always the one they‚Äôd turn to for help with school!

Not saying they don‚Äôt deserve it and I know there are a lot of factors at play here but idk kinda just feel low about everything rn...

My parents are separated and i only go on college tours with one of them at a time. The problem is when both of my parents want to go to a specific school. I hate college tours and info sessions but I have to go on some of them twice just for my parents. It‚Äôs so goddamn boring. I‚Äôm the one applying and I‚Äôm not getting any extra information from going to the same info session twice.

Edit: this sounds a lot worse than it is, lol. I‚Äôm super grateful that my parents are supportive of my college search. They get along well, but I prefer only going with one at a time on college trips. But anyway, this is the most upvotes I have ever gotten on a post so uhhhh thanks. And glad I was able to inspire some discussions and support in the comments. Love you all.

## [What I learned from my Stanford Deferral](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fmrv9g/what_i_learned_from_my_stanford_deferral/)
A few months ago I got deferred from Stanford. I was excited at the possibility of being a competitive candidate and maybe even attending my absolute dream school; however, I saw everyone else that got deferred as competition and factors I needed to be better than. After joining a chat with about 20 other deferees ( all from Reddit)- who were all amazing in their own right- I fell into a depression and suffered from major imposter syndrome, because many had done actual research and had national awards. Ultimately, they all scared me and it felt like my chance to attend my absolute dream school was slipping away from me. I had trouble texting them and just tried not come across as stupid, but one night everyone was sharing parts of their applications and their personal narrative. I decided to join along and learned a great deal about everyone in the chat and when I shared my story I was met with an unbelievable amount of support. The people in the chat with me started to become more than just my competition but other people who worked just as hard- if not harder- and wanted to attend Stanford just as much as I did. (I'm avoiding names cause I want to keep it private) There is one girl who constantly tells us how much she loves us, one who is the nicest person I've ever met, a boy we joke is our admissions officer, a really tall kid that believes in everyone, and so much more I couldn't possibly put into words. It really hit me that applying to these big schools makes you think you're against everyone else applying when, in reality, we're all just trying our hardest to achieve our goals and succeed in life. Every achievement in our group is met with an applause from everyone, and believe me these kids are out-of-this-world intelligent. We have people that got into MIT, a large number of likely letters from Ivy Leagues, a Duke likely, so many T20 acceptances already, and so many crazy smart people. I used to think kids like this were robots, but they are so human. We eat whole bottles of mayonnaise, preform the orchestra version of the Wii theme, tell dirty jokes, and spend so many hours just being high schoolers. After spending so long with them- and as Stanford approaches- I can't help but think that I no longer care if my spot goes to one of them. Will I be upset, yes; however, I know its another kid that is just trying to succeed. They all deserve as much as I do- if not more. However, I've also seen how unpredictable the process is, kids that got likely letters from Ivys get rejected from MIT or people from MIT don't get into other less prestigious schools. I don't say this to degrade them because they are easily some of the smartest people I've met- much smarter than me- but to show how fickle the whole process is. All in all, as Ivy Day and Stanford approaches I hope y'all can realize that the whole process is unpredictable and isn't indicative of your worth at all. Everyone on this sub is just a human trying to live their own unique experience. We're not each other's competition we're just kids. We're all on this Earth confused about what to do and how to make our dreams come true.

If any of my fellow Stanford Eggs are reading this I hope you all get in and I would give the world to be able to attend Stanny with you for the next four years. Hopefully we can beat the 15%-25% acceptance rate! Even if I don't get in I wouldn't change a thing. I loved meeting all of you and bonding over our love for Stanford and learning. After Stanford decisions we may never talk again, but I hope you know you truly touched my heart!

TLDR: Apply to big schools even if you think you're unqualified the best case scenario may change your life. Heck, I did and got deferred and got to meet some amazing people. Other candidates aren't your competition they're just kids like you- many have worked just as hard and want to attend just as much. Lastly, go easy on yourself. You're just a kid and college is confusing. A rejection doesn't mean anything and you're not inferior for receiving it; vice versa for an acceptance.

Also we're considering starting a youtube channel just as a resource for kids deferred from Stanford and to show what we wrote and did to get into great schools like MIT, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Vanderbilt, UCLA, Duke, Stanford(hopefully), and so many more great schools)

Edit: Oh my gosh ty so much for the awards and upvotes <3. I just wanted to put my feelings into words and hoped I could help others with my experiences. Best of luck to everyone!

## [8th grade predictions come true](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fc1j8d/8th_grade_predictions_come_true/)
So in 8th grade my English teacher made use write letters to our future senior selves, and I recently received mine! Part of the assignment was to list predictions for the future, including where you think you‚Äôre going to college. I had completely forgotten what I had written 4 years ago, but I was so surprised to see how accurate it was. My friends and I got kick out of reading it.

My 8th grade self claimed, with a decent amount of certainty, that I would either be going to Cornell or Yale, two schools that were arbitrarily picked because they sounded cool. I am now extremely excited to say that I have been accepted to Yale! It‚Äôs crazy to think that my extremely overconfident ‚Äúprediction,‚Äù more like crapshot, actually came true.

I thought that you guys would enjoy this wack story

## [UPenn Interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dsqydg/upenn_interview/)
I applied to Penn (UPenn) through the Questbridge National College Match. I wasn't expecting an alumni interview, because I didn't think there is anyone where I'm from (Northern Virginia). Yesterday, I got a call from someone pretending to be a ‚Äúsecret service‚Äù agent. What secret service agent would call a random high schooler and tell them they‚Äôre ‚Äúsecret service‚Äù. After a brief conversation, I realized she wasn‚Äôt kidding. I was supposed to interview with a Penn alumnus who worked in the White House, but she wouldn‚Äôt say who. She offered to send me a car the next afternoon to bring me to the White House. After a multitude of security checks, I was led into a room. It was a weird room because it was oval-shaped. A minute later, guess who enters the room. The man himself. We talked for about an hour, and he assured me that I was definitely getting into Penn and that a rejection letter was fake news.

## [I overheard my mom crying on the phone today because she wanted me to go to Harvard and I was rejected... even though I'll be starting at Northwestern in a few days](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d2v05v/i_overheard_my_mom_crying_on_the_phone_today/)
Made a throwaway to tell this story, since I really need a place to vent right now. Orientation at Northwestern starts super late due to the quarter system, so I've just been chilling at home while all my other friends have left for college. While I was watching TV in the living room last night, I thought I heard my mom say my name while she was on the phone in her bedroom. I was curious so I eavesdropped a little, and that's when I heard my mom sobbing "all I wanted was for (insert my name here) to go to Harvard, but he wasn't good enough." I don't know who she was talking to, but I'm assuming it was to a relative or a friend, since my mom is part of the Chinese community in my town that loves to gossip about college and especially about which colleges their kids will be attending. I left at that point and don't really know how I've been feeling since, and I guess that's why I'm venting here.

&nbsp;

So basically, my parents are both from China and met while they were both graduate students at Harvard. Ever since I was young, they constantly made it clear to me that Harvard was the only school that they wanted me to attend. Basically everything they made me do was to make me a more competitive applicant and increase my chances of getting into Harvard. They built up this expectation that I'd follow their legacy and didn't even consider that I might not get in. Fast forward to last December, and I found out I was deferred after applying early action. My parents were clearly disappointed, but still held out hope that I'd be accepted in the regular admissions cycle. Then, on decision day, I got my rejection letter and couldn't even look my parents in the eye. After getting all my decisions, I considered my choices and decided to attend Northwestern.

&nbsp;

Ever since, I could tell that they've been disappointed in me, even though they never said it to my face. It was always small comments like "oh I heard (insert name here) from your school got into Harvard, what do you think they did that you didn't?" or "I think Northwestern's a good school, but it's not in the same league as Harvard." Hearing my mom literally cry on the phone because I didn't get into Harvard was the confirmation I needed that they were, in fact, disappointed in me as their son. I'm sorry Mom, that I wasn't good enough to get into Harvard. I really fucking tried, okay? Northwestern's a good school too, I wish you could be happy that I was going there instead.

&nbsp;

Okay, rant over, thanks for listening.

## [I let it ruin my life. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/en4zk5/i_let_it_ruin_my_life_dont_make_the_same_mistake/)
Someone posted several days ago about how obsessing over college, grades, and extracurriculars ruined their life. I want to share my story.

I developed an adderall addiction early on in my high school career. When I was a freshman, I went on Reddit for study tips and I learned about the ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù effects of adderall. At my school, there are a lot of study drug dealers (uber competitive school) so I squandered a lot of money for just adderall. Now, as a senior, I have an adderall addiction  all because I wanted better grades and a perfect GPA.

I also started taking caffeine pills to stay awake and melatonin to help me sleep on the weekends to make up for the lost sleep time. Imagine how taxing this is to your body. One day, while studying for my chem exam, I took adderall *and* a caffeine pill at the same time and I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. I have never been more scared in my life.

I‚Äôve cried because I got a 35 on my ACT. I spent 90-something dollars in order to raise my score by a mere fucking point. All for what? An added marginal chance of 2.5% of getting into an Ivy League college?

I‚Äôve also become extremely judgmental about everyone around me. All I care about are grades and academic stats. Because of this, I have absolutely no fucking close friends at all. Being a good person with average grades is so much better than being an asshole with top-tier grades. Don‚Äôt be that asshole.

I did all of this because for my whole life I wanted to be a doctor. I finally broke down in my band director‚Äôs office today because I realized that being a doctor wasn‚Äôt my dream, I was only imagining that it was my dream because of the salary and my parents‚Äô wishes. My whole life I planned to be a doctor, and now, way into senior year, I realized that I have no path other than to become a doctor. I‚Äôm stuck in the middle of nowhere and it‚Äôs practically too late for me.

To those of you underclassmen, *please.* It‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôve severely impacted my mental and physical health and social life because I thought grades were the be-all-end-all. I wholeheartedly regret not doing the things I would have loved to do, like practice the piano more or make friends and go hiking with them or explore new hobbies instead of studying all the time.

Don‚Äôt let it ruin your life. Please.

## [The worst essays you can write](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e20pcf/the_worst_essays_you_can_write/)
**The "metaphor" essay**

If you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.

**The quirky, "outside of the box" essay**

i   a m APPLICANT

u    a r e ADMISSIONS OFFICER

p   l e   as e l et        m e      IN

**The sports injury essay**

It was the day of the big game. I had been preparing my whole life to play on that field that day. Sweat dripped down my face as I ran the warmup laps with my team. Suddenly I felt a horrible pain in my leg and I realized that I had stubbed my toe. "NO!" I gasped. "Not on the day of the big game!"

Coach looked solemnly at me. "Your career is over," he said. "You can't play in the big game now."

Suddenly his phone rang. He picked it up and frowned with concern. "Oh no! Our star player has just come down with the flu and won't be able to play. Now we don't have enough players for the big game. We're going to have to forfeit."

A burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. "No, we won't," I said, standing up resolutely. "I'm going to play."

Coach looked at me in awe.

That game I played like I had never played before, fighting through my agony for the team. Despite the unimaginable pain of my toe, I found it in me to score the winning goal. As I held the golden trophy above my head, I proudly realized that my hard work had gotten me here. Because, as Abraham Lincoln always said, winners never quit.

**The "thesaurus" essay**

I cherish to acquire comprehension in school, thus perusing volumes is my preoccupation. My incarnation is blithesome because I am disclosing new atmospheres and modes of quintessence. This scintillating diversion alleviates all malaises and obfuscations through elucidation. Whereas herein lies my denouement: construing utilization is my zeal.

**The sob story essay**

My life was never easy. I was born at a very young age, and was immediately plunged into hardship. I should have had a 4.9 GPA, however my numerous struggles have understandably resulted in my 1.7 GPA.

It all started with a birthday gift of AirPods. Unfortunately I received them just a week before the new AirPods 3 came out and everyone noticed my old-model AirPods and called me broke. Dear reader, the only thing broke was my heart. I couldn't even activate Siri with my model. However, I dusted myself off and trudged onwards. The next obstacle would be the one to shoot down my dreams. I had long hoped to launch a successful career as an Instagram influencer. With high hopes and my heart in my throat, I posted a selfie. To my horror, it received a measly 3 likes. This has wounded my spirit irreparably and I have since been struggling to cope. Obviously schoolwork has had to wait while I turn my attention to dealing with my greater problems.

**The overly descriptive essay**

At 6:35 am, I wake up and look at the lavender shade of my walls - not quite blue, not quite pink - and breathe in deeply. If my room were a clock, I have a periodic table poster above my closet at 3 o'clock, a world map slightly to the right of my desk at 9 o'clock, and a certificate for my work in cancer research at 11 o'clock. As I get up, I am aware of the white paint on my door and the soft fluff of my beige rug. Today is a cold day, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3333 degrees Celsius. I slip on my puffy green winter jacket and my bright red Nikes and step outside onto the cracked gray sidewalk. As I walk, I glance at a small brown squirrel darting across the long black power line. Soon it is time for school, where I will fill my inquisitive mind with knowledge and apply my bountiful observational skills.

**The inspirational service trip essay**

Through my service trip to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\], I learned that helping others is good. This led to the realization that service is my passion. That is why I will be perfect for helping others by being a doctor/lawyer/CS programmer. As soon as I arrived in a poorer country with my $2,500 summer program, I started to miss the clean streets of my Silicon Valley neighborhood. But I took pictures with local children and followed my tour group around, so now I know just what it means to dedicate oneself to service. Here's the funny thing: I went to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] to help others, but what I didn't know is that they had helped me. Due to the five days that I spent in \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] I have become more caring and aware and humble. These are all qualities that I will bring to the UC Hicago/St. Anford campus.

**The "intellectual curiosity" essay**

For as long as I can remember, I have always asked "why?" to everyone around me. As a child, I practically lived in libraries, carrying wagons of encyclopedias home every night. I blew through sixty books a day, and even that wasn't enough for my thicc brain. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that could never be satisfied, not by Einstein's treatises on relativity, not by the Feynman physics lectures. By the age of three, I was writing academic papers with my crayons. In conclusion, I have am quite a curious intellectual. Harvard, please let me in.

edit: i had no idea that this would blow up so much, thank you so much to everyone for being so kind! + thanks for all your support ‚ù§Ô∏è

edit 2: bruh why did this become the #5 most upvoted post of all time in r/ApplyingToCollege thanks guys!

Good luck on AP Calc and all your other exams!!

Edit: I thought my AB exam was pretty easy for the most part. In other news, I‚Äôm looking for 60 dozen jars and 12 black pans. Please DM me if you can hook me up!

Edit 2: I literally didn‚Äôt submit anything for my Euro exam. Time ran out half a second before I was going to press submit. I hate my life.

Edit 3: At least I submitted my AP Chem exam, but I think I got the hardest form.

## [I'm tired of this game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/deaqv2/im_tired_of_this_game/)
My whole life I've always been told to do my best, but where does it stop? You can always do more, you can always sacrifice your fucking life for a goal, but what's the price you end up paying?

I threw everything valuable in life away by chasing the fucking first letter of the alphabet. I have no social skills. I have no hobbies. I am horribly neurotic. I'm irritable all the time. I have brain fog all the time. I've spent so much of my doing the shit that I "should do" that I've never pursued what I care about. When people ask me what I do for fun I make up some bullshit answer, because I don't do anything for fun. School is my life, and I can't slow down now or all this work would have been for nothing.

My dad is fucking 65 years old. I don't really have any meaningful interaction with him outside of the weekends, and even then I'm always pissed because of school. Was the SAT score worth it? Is the fucking number 4.0 worth it? How much time am I realistically going to have left with him?

I'm probably going to apply ED to a T20 school, but part of me hopes that I just end up at my state school. I'm tired of this game, and will it ever end if I go to a T20?  I would get a whole lot more out of learning how to party and have a good time than i would to keep chasing this shit. I just want to be content in life with people I care about, but instead I sit around procrastinating all day because of how burned out and unfulfilled I am from this game, and it keeps me distracted from how far behind I've fallen in every part of my life.

Fuck this game. It's not worth it. I can't wait until second semester when I'll actually be able to embrace everything I've neglected in life for so long.

## [Unfortunate truth for people making final college decisions: School prestige does matter quite a bit for finance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g8i1rs/unfortunate_truth_for_people_making_final_college/)
I ended up browsing this a sub a lot this year to get back to speed on the college application process to help my sibling. Fortunately, people know that school prestige isn‚Äôt everything, but there is some misinformation regarding it for finance.



School prestige DOES matter a lot for finance. This is due to the fact that you are in a client-facing role and you‚Äôd rather have an analyst from Wharton or Stanford representing you over someone from Penn State, all things being equal. While there are plenty that break in outside of the ‚Äútarget‚Äù schools, outside of students from UVA, Mich, Berkeley, Kelley, etc. You don‚Äôt see much from schools like Iowa or PSU.



This is somewhat of a cycle, as alums from targets prefer students from their school, but it‚Äôs not impossible to break in. That being said, if you‚Äôre looking for the easiest route into Wall Street, I‚Äôd consider taking on more debt to go to a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù perceived school.



Edit: didn‚Äôt even get to mention top management consulting firms. If you‚Äôre shooting for MBB, if you don‚Äôt go to a target AND have a near perfect GPA and resume, you have almost no shot. Even I couldn‚Äôt get an offer there back when I was in undergrad.

Honestly, I wish I applied to more colleges but I was being a lazy rat and made too many excuses that I regret now.

Edit:

Also don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself with college apps. But at the same time, take this extra free time to study for the ACTs/SATs (take the essay portion of you can) and start writing ur major essay for common app! Create your college list! Finish that college board scholarship!

OMG DONT FORGET TO APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS NOW!! I regret not doing that either üò≠

You will thank yourself in the future.

P.S. should I start a blog for those who need help with the college admission process?

## [My high school class is boycotting online classes. This is wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g2hzat/my_high_school_class_is_boycotting_online_classes/)
Yesterday, my HS principal sent a blast email saying that the Class of 2020's prom was cancelled, the senior awards would be presented online, the summa cum laude recognition would also be held online, and the final sting: in-person graduation was cancelled.

This morning, in our senior class Facebook group, several of my peers decided they would organize a "senior skip day" for online school to express their disappointment in our administration. Just a few hours ago, another student shared a long, heart-wrenching email that she sent to our district superintendent, which went into detail about her mom who has cancer and won't make it to her college graduation, wedding, etc. The student's high school graduation, which the mom would've been able to attend, was gone. She has poured kerosene to the flames.

I'm mad our graduation is gone, too. I immigrated to the States with my family when I was 8 years old, and for the past three years, I've been telling my single mom that I'd work to deliver a speech in my high school graduation to tell everyone in the stadium about the sacrifices she's made and express just how thankful I am for her. A normal thank you wouldn't convey my gratitude; a thank you in front of thousands of people, however, could. I also wanted to celebrate how much I've grown as an individual, and thank my friends who were there for me when I ran away from home, encountered a period of depression, etc. Only a proper thank you in front of thousands could express my gratitude.

No matter how disappointed I am at the news of my graduation's cancellation, I do not doubt for a second the decision that my district administration made. What if just one person--out of the thousands that would attend the gathering--brought the coronavirus? Dozens--if not more--would catch it. What if the girl, whose mom has cancer, acquires the virus and brings it home with her? What will happen to her mother with breast cancer? To the girl: I understand your heartbreak, but what would your mom do? I hope she would choose to protect the lives of hundreds, including hers, at the sacrifice of an monumental experience--a choice that I consider heroic and wise.

All it takes is one--one out of thousands--to put the lives of dozens in danger. What if all--no, just a few hundred--of the high schools across the US hosted graduations? The physical, economic damage will be unimaginable. We seniors might not even have the fall semester of college. Do we need the spring semester off as well?

Now, I stay home to protect my 50-year-old mom. This is how I express my gratitude for her. I haven't seen a single person outside my family for the past few weeks in order to protect my family. Most of the students here have parents who are aged 50 or older, and let's protect them by staying home.

Rant over.

## [full circle!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fq6oic/full_circle/)
I just sent this email to my 6th grade biology teacher:

‚ÄúHello!

I was in your 6th grade biology class at (blank) and also in your Science club for all three years of middle school. I remember during one particular biology class you were teaching us about Cornell notes and you said in passing, ‚ÄúIf any of you guys get into Cornell University in a few years, come back so I can give you a huge hug.‚Äù

I never forgot this class, so I wanted to tell you that yesterday I was admitted to Cornell University!! You were the teacher that really introduced me to science and sparked my interests and now, 6 years later, I‚Äôm about to go to college on a pre-med track. I just wanted to thank you since I live abroad and I can‚Äôt exactly visit you. Thank you for everything!!‚Äù

and she told me she could never forget me and that she was proud of me ü•∫ü•∫

I‚Äôm crying y‚Äôall omg

I've been seeing so many posts recently about T20s not being the end all, be all, and I wanted to share something a bit more personal.


As someone who is waiting alone at the gate to my flight, I can tell you right now to hold your loved ones close. I thought I would be glad to leave my crazy family, the endless divorce settlement, my overbearing siblings, my lack of friends, and frankly the country I was living in. And I can tell you for a fact that I packed my bags with blurred vision. That I was blown away by the sendoff I received from people I thought would never give me a second thought,  be it estranged family or schoolmates I barely interacted with. That I cried omw to the airport with my sisters and mother holding on to me as tight as they could. And as I sit at Starbucks, waiting for my flight an hour and a half from now, I'm  contemplating everything I thought I knew. But the one thing I'm sure of, is that I have no regrets. Hold your family close, you will miss them dearly.


Love to all the A2C family that helped me along my journey. Here's to a new start for us all!


P.S. If anyone is from Dallas, I'll be joining you soon :)

## [CollegeBoard is the best organization ever. Here‚Äôs why.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fst2i9/collegeboard_is_the_best_organization_ever_heres/)
I just want to show my enthusiasm for this amazing new sponsorship for A2C. Here are my top 7(I have to go to bed soon so I can‚Äôt list all 696 reasons) on why CollegeBoard is the absolute best thing to happen to us.

1: They are a nonprofit. We know as fact that the $80 registration fees for the SAT and AP tests are put to good use. And the $800 million they earn each year is of course used for scholarships and other wonderful causes.

2: They provide an excellent test to determine our readiness for college. Scoring a 1600 shows my superiority over someone with a meek 1580. The only reason I didn‚Äôt get into Harvard was because I only scored a 790 in the SAT Gender Studies Subject Test.

3: AP courses are the best way to prepare us for college. Who cares if taking 13 AP classes in one year damages us psychologically? At least we‚Äôll be ready to thrive at SUNY Ithaca.

4: They are brilliant for introducing curves onto a standardized test to help all of us out. -30 for one question in Math is an awesome implementation.

5: They reuse tests to save money, which is used for all the wonderful causes I mentioned earlier.

6: When they accidentally screwed up the June 2018 SAT, they didn‚Äôt refund anybody. In fact, they didn‚Äôt even apologize. This shows that they were too busy working on fixing the issue that they didn‚Äôt even have time to refund or apologize.

7: It‚Äôs so wonderful that we get to send scores to colleges directly from collegeboard! And it‚Äôs free, too, if you decide to send it before you actually receive your scores.

So there it is! CollegeBoard is the best organization I have ever encountered in my 18 depressing years here on this planet. A true non-profit, and I can‚Äôt wait for the amazing things they will bring to r/ApplyingToCollege .

I get that a lot of people with high scores and GPA asking if they will get into decent schools can be frustrating. I get it. Its annoying.

But at the same time, these people are just stressed out. They've worked their butts off all of high school and they are getting last minute jitters. They just want to vent. Let them. If it pisses you off that much then dont upvote them. Or better yet, downvote them. But dont post the same post that everyone is posting about those people being annoying. This subreddit is for advice about college admissions and, just as importantly, for student who are scared or nervous about their futures. Let's support each other. No reason to needlessly hate :)

Getting in alone was such a shock, now it‚Äôs like getting admitted the second time, especially given that Georgetown says their aid for intl student is extremely limited!

My fellow internationals, IT REALLY NEVER HURTS TO TRY!!

**Edit:** **Thank you all for your congrats!! I really appreciate it!**

**Edit 2:** Sorry, I wouldn't share my stats. I don't think it'll help anyone. My stats is well above average but I believe it wasn't what set my application apart. It's perhaps the case for most internationals, who are usually in a hella competitive pool as a result of self-selection. Once you've got good numbers, they don't matter that much anymore, so I don't want my stats to mislead other kids.

As a high school student, I definitely fit the bill of a depressed, unmotivated student wasting their potential. I would consistently show up late or occasionally skip school, and I only started working on assignments the night before they were due. I was in the IB programme, and my GPA was around a 3.1 with a handful of Cs and 2 Ds. I had a 1370 on my SAT which is good, but not incredible. At the end of my junior year, I realized that I was only setting myself up for failure in life and I wanted to start trying in school for once. I would go to places like collegeconfidential and feel like shit about myself because of my grades. Sites like these naturally attract the high achievers, which is fine, but it's demoralizing going online trying to get a better education and seeing peers list your reaches as safeties.

&#x200B;

I ended up going to a state school for college (not going to name names for privacy reasons, but think Ohio State, Arizona State, etc.) and found a subject I was passionate about. More importantly, I found the motivation to work hard and go the extra mile because I was sick of not living up to my own expectations. 4 years later, and now I'm the first person from my department to ever attend MIT.

&#x200B;

The reason I want to make this post is to tell the people who feel this way that you can still go on to do big things (even in school!) despite a mediocre high school GPA. If you have any questions you can comment or DM me.

&#x200B;

I'd be happy to send proof to the mods if they want.

## [As the Ivy Day approaches...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fo52vz/as_the_ivy_day_approaches/)
It easy for our friends, parents, relatives, and others to form an opinion of us based on the colleges that we get into. But, for us, it is important to remember that "opinion" is a just a social construct; its made-up, its not necessarily your reality. And ***"Someone's opinion of you does not have to become your reality."*** **(Les Brown)** Be it your haters or your very loved ones. Only you and you should define yourself.

It great if you get into those IVY leagues, Stanford, Caltech, MIT, or the reputed T20s. You sure have a kickstart to your professional life with the networks you will create and the opportunities you will take advantage of. Be happy and rejoice, you deserve it. However, to think that this success makes you superior to your peers who didn't get into these colleges is outrightly incorrect. Sometimes, we adopt such a thinking unconsciously; like we start treating ourselves differently if we get into a great college and vice-versa. (I've seen it with a couple of my friends) Does a college decision determine how "able" we are/were? No. Do rejections discount the hard-work we put into our exams, classes, ECs, and essays? No. Does an acceptance somehow enhance "the road that we have already traversed"? No. They, why do we let ourselves affected by them so much? Sure, an acceptance could give us validation for the work that we have done. But, if validation is all what you seek, don't forget that "college decisions" are not the only way.

If you are doing good work, putting in "those extra hours of hardwork outside your comfort zones", and heading towards your dreams slowly but persistently, you are sure to get tons of "validations" in future. You will get medals, your work will be published in reputed journals, and you will eventually get  recognitions for the work you do. Just be unstoppable. And, as Steve Jobs said *"Believe that the dots will somehow connect in the future. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to keep working, even when it leads you off the well worn path."*

**Don't put so much weight on the decision part.** It sure is difficult, but this mental detachment is essential for you to keep moving forward. If you get acceptances, don't just start assuming that you will do well with everything you do in future. If you get rejections, don't behave as if you've lost on everything, and all the work that you have done means nothing. Learn what went wrong with you and what went right. And keeping working.

Also, remember that the admission officer that judges you is not the wisest man/woman on earth. He/she could have had prejudices and your decision is of-course dependent on uncountable unpredictable factors. Don't let him/her take control of the "most defining moment of your life". What I mean to say is that don't think of an admission decision as the "most defining moment". You were born to do greater things than just getting into good colleges. Take that burden off your shoulders. Breath in. Breath out. And focus on the longer journey.

Hope things work in your favour but more importantly, I hope you keep working on your dreams irrespective of these admission outcomes are.

## [Letter from an Ivy League student and former A2C member](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d3wehk/letter_from_an_ivy_league_student_and_former_a2c/)
*Okay let me start off by saying the ‚Äúivy league student‚Äù part of the title was solely for clicks. I attend Penn but this is not going to be specific to just the ivy league, for the barrier that is put up between other schools and ivy is very much manufactured.*

I know you are all incredibly stressed and, whether it‚Äôs from your parents or your peers or yourself, dealing with lots and lots of pressure to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in the college application process; however, **please look into the CULTURE of schools you are applying to.** Yes, prestige is important, but the difference in culture between T20 schools is far greater than the difference in prestige of #5 and #15.

Take Penn for example. Never in my life have I been so swamped. Everything here is stressful. Clubs take less than 5% of applicants, greek life is brutally difficult to keep up with, classes are not easy, shit is hard. But that‚Äôs just the culture, and quite honestly that helps me thrive. But that‚Äôs just not right for lots of people, and I see that every single day when people crack. Kids kill themselves at college. It happens. These places are absolute pressure cookers. Brown on the other hand, while still difficult, has a significantly different culture which would match up with someone much different and more lax.

Just be careful. Don‚Äôt go somewhere because of its ranking without further investigation into the actual culture. Most schools aren‚Äôt a fit for most people, that‚Äôs just how life works, so don‚Äôt force yourself into going somewhere where you clash with the culture and will be depressed. Two days ago the director of counseling here killed himself. It‚Äôs bleak. It‚Äôs sad. It‚Äôs hard. Find yourself a place where you can thrive accordingly. If you are like me and succeed under extreme stress, by all means apply to the insanely competitive cultured schools. If you feel as though high school is eating you alive and can‚Äôt wait to make it to college to catch your breath, find a school where you can actually do that.

Put yourself first.
Please

## [For all y‚Äôall that need to improve your social skills before college](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f61kqf/for_all_yall_that_need_to_improve_your_social/)
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of posts about losing out on high school experiences and stuff so here‚Äôs some pointers on how to get conversations going and make some friends in college.

1. Ask about their day/weekend. People usually can go on and on about their weekends.

2. Talk about politics...maybe. There‚Äôs always something on the news about politics so you can just talk about that but don‚Äôt get too defensive and whatnot otherwise you‚Äôll make enemies instead of friends.

3. Sports. Basketball and football are hot topics. I can talk on and on about basketball plus there are games like everyday so there‚Äôs always something to talk about.

4. Music. I found a lot of my friends through music. Just ask them what their favorite music is and see if you can can listen to songs together /recommend any songs.

5. Summer plans. Ik summer‚Äôs long off but people have already been planning it (trips, internships, jobs, etc)

6. Driving. A lot of people our age are driving now so just talk about scary experiences or like how to get a license.

7. Ask about a homework assignment. Even though you may know how to do it, sometimes just asking for the sake of conversation can help develop friendships.

8. This kinda relates to 2 but just talk about what‚Äôs on the news. Like the coronavirus, for example.

9. Just complain. About driving, about parents, about siblings, about a teacher, about homework, about a test, etc. People usually have A LOT to say if they‚Äôre complaining about something.

These are some basic tips! Please drop any other pointer in the comments!

## [Unpopular opinion: the magic in your essays exist predominantly in rough drafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c8huok/unpopular_opinion_the_magic_in_your_essays_exist/)
As we continue to revise constantly over and over, we lose the voice that gave our essays that unique spark.

People criticized my UC essays much more than my common app essays even though my UC essays were revised much much more. This was because my UC essays barely had voice.

(If truth be told, my common app essay was barely a second draft. All my stanford essays are rough drafts.)

I feel that this is because people feel like they have a right to criticize something where no voice and/or personality is attached to it.

This leads me to an important point: stand out so much to the admissions officers that they feel like rejecting you is equivalent to shooting your friend.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to be informal and use parentheses and such. In fact, your essays should read like this post.

Then again, this is an unpopular opinion of mine :)

And these are also very, very deserving candidates.  First generation, low-income, wonderful musicians, talented humanists, etc, etc, etc.

So please, do your friends and classmates a favor and email the admissions office to withdraw if there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre going to that college.  Thank you!

## [I was rejected from Harvard as a senior in high school. This fall, I‚Äôll be going there for grad school. Here‚Äôs some advice!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/figxab/i_was_rejected_from_harvard_as_a_senior_in_high/)
I was rejected from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell when I was a high school senior. A few days ago, I got into Harvard to do my Master‚Äôs. My advice is this: Stay determined, get a great education, and find out what you really like.

You can do those 3 things anywhere. And once you find out what you like studying, you‚Äôll be pleased to find out that grad school admissions, in many cases, are far less competitive than undergrad admissions. So, if you didn‚Äôt get into your dream school this year, don‚Äôt worry. Unlike undergrad admissions, you also don‚Äôt have to be amazing. In many cases, if you‚Äôre just a good student who can do the work, you can get in!

Fun fact: the average age of entering students at my program at Harvard is around 27 years old. This means that those people went to college, graduated, worked 5ish years doing something, and then decided to go back to school and got into Harvard. And this isn‚Äôt unique to Harvard. Many graduate and professional schools have a majority of their students over the age of 25. Life is long and it‚Äôs hard to know what your path will look like when you‚Äôre only 18. So, just do things you care about. If Harvard or Stanford is your dream, you can end up there eventually.

## [My Dartmouth interviewer made a *SIZE* joke during my interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/exdvdn/my_dartmouth_interviewer_made_a_size_joke_during/)
I wish this was a shitpost...

The interviewer I got was probably in his late 50s to early 60s, very proud of his school, and struck me as the 'former frat boy' type.

He starts the interview by asking, "What's your biggest accomplishment?"

Me: "Hm, I would definitely say my biggest acc-"

Him: "Not that size matters, ha! I bet you wouldn't worry about that" **(gesturing down)**

*(For context, I'm about 6'4")*

At first I thought he was talking about my height and laughed with him, thinking this was one of those *"oh wow you're so tall, do you play basketball?"* moments... until I realized what he actually meant. It was actually really funny now that I think of it. I wasn't uncomfortable or anything, it just caught me off guard.

Overall though the interview went really ~~good~~ well! He was a fun personality- it just took some getting used to!

Edit: Again, not a shitpost. Yes it actually happened.

Edit 2: Grammar

We‚Äôve started doing things like randomly shouting out or complimenting people in the grade who deserve praise.

In a short post-meeting interview, Harvard president Lawrence Bacow made these remarks: ‚ÄúYeah man, we looked at the numbers, and noticed that 36 is a hell of a lot less than 1600.

## [Warning don't jump into trade school hastily either.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ctz4kt/warning_dont_jump_into_trade_school_hastily_either/)
I went to trade school for IT and did really well! I earned two highly respected certifications: CompTIA A+ and Network+ straight As, helped out in events and with broken PCs brought in, student government captain, the whole 9 yards.. Here's the thing though, when I graduated and looked for a job, I got a 5 month internship, mostly cause my school had a good relationship with that company. It was alright, but I got super unlucky and was one of the 5-10 help desk technicians who had to work every weekend. Same 5-10 people. After that contract job ended, since I didn't have a degree or more experience, no one else wanted to hire me. So basically, I ended up wasting over a year and a half trying to go the trade school route, only to have to go back to the college route.

What I learned is that trade school is ideal for people who have the ambition to start their own business with whatever trade they had. I had no such ambition. Frankly I just wanted to put my 40 hours in, do my best in that time and live my life after that. However if you do have that ambition, by all means, go to trade school. Otherwise, to work for most companies, you will need to earn a degree. At least with IT, I'm not so familiar with other trades, but I feel it will be the same if you try to work for a medium/ large coorparate company, or you'll need other methods/experience to stand out.

Regardless trade school isn't some quick / easy ticket out of the world of 4 year unis. That's the important thing to take from this. You are going to come in the work force, in many cases at a disadvantage frankly in many situations and will need to fight tooth and nail to earn the privilege to work. A fight that's not as hard for those with degrees, though there are still challenges.

Sorry for a downer , I just, saw someone talk about finishing uni and at age 24, I couldn't help but get a bit depressed about the crazy path I took due to how things played out for me, (which I've explained multiple times on this board) so I wanted to give out some truth for people considering going down the path that was, for me, a mistake. Trade school can be a good choice, but actually look into what types of jobs you can get with your trade and what they will look for.

## [Guide to the new University of California application system](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ccrwxq/guide_to_the_new_university_of_california/)
Hey there, stressed senior! As you may have heard, the UC schools have a new application portal this year, which is slightly different from the previous one. You will be one of the first people to apply to UC schools with this new system. To help you apply, I've put together a short guide. I found applying needlessly complicated last year using the old system, so hopefully, this guide will help take some of the confusion out for you.

The UC application is divided into *7 primary sections*.

* About you
* Campuses & majors
* Academic history
* Test scores
* Activites & awards
* Scholarships & programs
* Personal insight

# About you

In this section, you will be filling in personal info. You shouldn't have too much of an issue filling in these fields. Just as a note, your citizenship will determine which pool of applicants you are placed into, and residency will determine your applicant pool **and** tuition.

UC places its applicants into three general pools, each increasingly harder than the last to be admitted. California residents pay the least on tuition, somewhere in the ballpark of $10-20k in tuition, out-of-state US citizens and international students pay around $35-45k. California students are also more likely to be admitted, but you must be living in and graduate from a CA high school to qualify.

[For reference](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/student-profile), at UC Berkeley in 2018, the admissions rate for CA residents was 17.1%, for OOS students 15.4% and for international students 8.7%. CA residents also have a lower average GPA and standardized test scores.

UC schools are prohibited by law from using affirmative action to admit students.

At the end of the section, you will have a chance to review all the information you submitted.

# Campuses and majors

In this section, you will select which of the 9 UC campuses to apply to. Not all UC schools are created equal, and some are definitely easier to get into than others, but this doesn't mean any one campus is "bad". You will get a quality education from any UC campus.

|*School*|*Acceptance Rate for Class of 2023*|*QS World Ranking*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|UC Berkeley|16.8%|28|
|UC Los Angeles (UCLA)|12.4%|35|
|UC San Diego (UCSD)|32.3%|45|
|UC Davis|39.1%|104|
|UC Santa Barbara (UCSB)|29.7%|135|
|UC Irvine|26.6%|219|
|UC Santa Cruz (UCSC)|51.8%|367|
|UC Riverside|56.7%|454|
|UC Merced|75.4%|Unranked|

While creating your account, you were asked which term you were applying for admission into.

[https://i.postimg.cc/Gm19ZgDC/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-07-36-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Gm19ZgDC/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-07-36-PM.png)

You will then get a beautiful map of where all the UC campuses are, which is new to the appl. system. This page also gives you an estimated total application cost, and this cost will automatically be deducted if you qualify for a fee waiver:

[https://i.postimg.cc/CKTCr4hB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-08-13-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CKTCr4hB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-08-13-PM.png)

After choosing a major, some campuses will let you pick both a major and an alternate major. UC campuses and colleges differ in how they admit students. Some admit students directly into a major or pre-major, while others, like Berkeley's Letters and Science, admit students to the college as an undeclared.

# Academic history

On this section, you will fill in the high schools you went to, and what grades you receive. While it is theoretically possible to lie, once you are admitted, you will need to send in your transcript (or rather, your school counselor must send it in). The grades must match exactly, and any significant differences would likely jeopardize your admission, so fill this section out truthfully and honestly.

[https://i.postimg.cc/N0663rFN/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-10-01-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/N0663rFN/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-10-01-PM.png)

They will first ask you if you took any high school courses while in grades 7 and 8. They do not care about other courses you took in this time.

[https://i.postimg.cc/hPZpsxQT/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-11-55-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPZpsxQT/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-11-55-PM.png)

You will then need to add your high school:

[https://i.postimg.cc/C1CcsQbx/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-12-40-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/C1CcsQbx/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-12-40-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/fyKgDrbr/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-13-12-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fyKgDrbr/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-13-12-PM.png)

As well as other basic info such as how often grades are reported and on what scale. You can add more than one:

[https://i.postimg.cc/j5q7BgG5/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-16-08-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/j5q7BgG5/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-16-08-PM.png)

You will then need to fill in every course you took and what grade you got between 9th and 12th grades inclusive.

[https://i.postimg.cc/qqd9kKxz/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-18-47-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qqd9kKxz/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-18-47-PM.png)

You should also report if you took any college classes while you were in high school, and where.

[https://i.postimg.cc/nhkVNFZ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-31-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhkVNFZ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-31-PM.png)

And finally, there is an "other info" section you can use to clarify anything unclear here, such as your school's grading system (if you ticked other) etc.

[https://i.postimg.cc/PJ8BH4DG/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-53-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/PJ8BH4DG/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-53-PM.png)

# Test scores

Here, you should fill in any ACT or SAT scores you have, and when you are planning to submit. For fall entry, you can last take an SAT/ACT in December, which must be immediately sent as the score is received.

Any scores you self-report here must be sent to the school electronically via CollegeBoard or the ACT website.

[https://i.postimg.cc/fRZTHt4W/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-21-43-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fRZTHt4W/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-21-43-PM.png)

You can send in a score to any UC campus and it will be received by any UC campus you apply to (I think this is still valid, I only sent in my score to Berkeley and UCLA offered me admission).

[https://i.postimg.cc/1XhZf2sR/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-22-18-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1XhZf2sR/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-22-18-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/pdSvtySF/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-14-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pdSvtySF/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-14-PM.png)

This is what it will look like once you fill in your scores:

[https://i.postimg.cc/wjTYyh8N/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-52-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wjTYyh8N/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-52-PM.png)

You will then be asked if you have any SAT Subject tests. You will also need to verify any self-reported scores by sending them to the school.

[https://i.postimg.cc/fLP61FJj/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-24-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fLP61FJj/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-24-PM.png)

You will also need to report AP scores, if you took any AP classes:

[https://i.postimg.cc/3wtMFWhq/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-50-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3wtMFWhq/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-50-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/1zsPKLq8/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-19-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1zsPKLq8/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-19-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/LXvsfmQ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-44-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LXvsfmQ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-44-PM.png)

Or IB scores, if you took IB:

[https://i.postimg.cc/wBpxG1ST/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-26-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wBpxG1ST/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-26-11-PM.png)

Any exam you have a predicted grade for should be filled in predicted grades. You cannot add the same class to both the first section and the second section.

[https://i.postimg.cc/WbzdGJPB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-27-12-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/WbzdGJPB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-27-12-PM.png)

You also need to report your TOEFL or IELTS score, if you have one (needed if your school does not teach primarily in English), as well as other exams such as O-levels or GCSE and their scores. You do not need to send in official reports.

# Activities and Awards

In this redesigned activities section, you can report up to twenty activites you may have done, including:

* Award or honor
* Educational preparation programs
* Extracurricular activity
* Other coursework
* Volunteer/Community service
* Work experience

[https://i.postimg.cc/pRL5b3ns/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-30-51-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pRL5b3ns/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-30-51-PM.png)

For awards and honors, you will need to name the award, the level of recognition (was it an international competition? state tournament?), whether the award was academic, when you received the award, and now, explain how award recipients are chosen and why you got it. These short explanations are new to the new UC application. In the previous application, you could only fill in 5 activities for each kind, but you did not have to explain how awards were chosen etc. It was simply a list.

Of course, that's a good mix to have. Try to do one activity in each, so you will have at least something to report. It doesn't mean focus on having an equivalent award in each - you can rarely have an international level math award and also be a well known activist, for example - but try to show the schools that beyond your one hook, you can also do other things. Again, it's fine if you don't have one in every single one - I was admitted to both schools I applied to without having work experience, college coursework or research work that colleges like.

# Personal insight

Here, you will find the "application essays" every college asks for. UC schools require 4 essays of 250-350 words each, but one set of four essays is used for all 9 campuses you apply to. Write these essays prior to beginning the application and simply copy paste them into the fields when you're actually applying. Here are the eight questions/prompts:

>From the UC website:
>
>**1. Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.** ¬†*Things to consider:* A leadership role can mean more than just a title. It can mean being a mentor to others, acting as the person in charge of a specific task, or taking the lead role in organizing an event or project. Think about what you accomplished and what you learned from the experience. What were your responsibilities?¬†
>
>Did you lead a team? How did your experience change your perspective on leading others? Did you help to resolve an important dispute at your school, church, in your community or an organization? And your leadership role doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be limited to school activities. For example, do you help out or take care of your family?
>
>**2. Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.** *Things to consider:*¬†What does creativity mean to you? Do you have a creative skill that is important to you? What have you been able to do with that skill? If you used creativity to solve a problem, what was your solution? What are the steps you took to solve the problem?
>
>How does your creativity influence your decisions inside or outside the classroom? Does your creativity relate to your major or a future career?
>
>**3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?** ¬†*Things to consider:* If there‚Äôs a talent or skill that you‚Äôre proud of, this is the time to share it. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be recognized or have received awards for your talent (although if you did and you want to talk about it, feel free to do so). Why is this talent or skill meaningful to you?
>
>Does the talent come naturally or have you worked hard to develop this skill or talent? Does your talent or skill allow you opportunities in or outside the classroom? If so, what are they and how do they fit into your schedule?
>
>**4. Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.** *Things to consider:* An educational opportunity can be anything that has added value to your educational experience and better prepared you for college. For example, participation in an honors or academic enrichment program, or enrollment in an academy that‚Äôs geared toward an occupation or a major, or taking advanced courses that interest you ‚Äî just to name a few.¬†
>
>If you choose to write about educational barriers you‚Äôve faced, how did you overcome or strive to overcome them? What personal characteristics or skills did you call on to overcome this challenge? How did overcoming this barrier help shape who are you today?
>
>**5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?** *Things to consider:* A challenge could be personal, or something you have faced in your community or school. Why was the challenge significant to you? This is a good opportunity to talk about any obstacles you‚Äôve faced and what you‚Äôve learned from the experience. Did you have support from someone else or did you handle it alone?
>
>If you‚Äôre currently working your way through a challenge, what are you doing now, and does that affect different aspects of your life? For example, ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow has my life changed at home, at my school, with my friends or with my family?‚Äù
>
>**6. ¬†Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.**¬†*Things to consider:*¬†¬†Many students have a passion for one specific academic subject area, something that they just can‚Äôt get enough of. If that applies to you, what have you done to further that interest? Discuss how your interest in the subject developed and describe any experience you have had inside and outside the classroom ‚Äî such as volunteer work, internships, employment, summer programs, participation in student organizations and/or clubs ‚Äî and what you have gained from your involvement.
>
>Has your interest in the subject influenced you in choosing a major and/or future career? Have you been able to pursue coursework at a higher level in this subject (honors, AP, IB, college or university work)? Are you inspired to pursue this subject further at UC, and how might you do that?
>
>**7. What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?** ¬†*Things to consider:* Think of community as a term that can encompass a group, team or a place ‚Äî¬†like your high school, hometown or home. You can define community as you see fit, just make sure you talk about your role in that community. Was there a problem that you wanted to fix in your community?
>
>Why were you inspired to act? What did you learn from your effort? How did your actions benefit others, the wider community or both? Did you work alone or with others to initiate change in your community?
>
>**8.¬†Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?** *Things to consider:*¬†¬†If there‚Äôs anything you want us to know about you, but didn‚Äôt find a question or place in the application to tell us, now‚Äôs your chance. What have you not shared with us that will highlight a skill, talent, challenge or opportunity that you think will help us know you better?
>
>From your point of view, what do you feel makes you an excellent choice for UC? Don‚Äôt be afraid to brag a little.

## [Interesting Notes from a Stanford Admissions Officer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fys18x/interesting_notes_from_a_stanford_admissions/)
I got off a call with my Stanford AO, and here are some expected and unexpected things he said about Stanford's admissions process:

1. **Your application is read several times by many people.** The first person who reads it is the person on the website that's assigned to your region (your regional admissions officer). However after that, many other random people will read your application.
2. **The final decision is made by a committee.** It's your regional AO's job to present you to the committee in a very objective way. Your AO will also pull out bits and pieces of your essays, resume, teacher recs, and other stuff to present. Your AO will also give a recommendation: accept or reject (or maybe waitlist/defer?). The way he talked made it seem like most of the time the committee agrees with the AO's recommendation, but not always. It was unclear how many votes you needed to be admitted.
3. **INTERESTING: The number and type of people on a committee differs by applicant.** My AO got weirdly ominous and vague when someone asked how many people sit on a committee. He said, "it depends on the applicant" in a more serious tone. *How* he answered was definitely the interesting part. My guess is that who sits on your committee could depend on whether you're a recruited athlete, a legacy, someone with connections, etc. It was certainly the most interesting thing that happened in the call.
4. **Once the committee has voted, the decision is final and there's no going back.** Someone asked if there was room for debate if there was a split vote, he said no.
5. **Your intended major matters, but not in the way you're thinking.** Stanford doesn't evaluate ethnic studies majors any differently than they evaluate CS majors. It's just as easy to get in as a history major as it is as a human bio major. However, my AO said it was another part of your application that is weighed with everything else. Just like everything in your folder, your intended major is a part of crafting your whole story. This can certainly affect your admissions. For example, if your application is sparatic and all over the place, it'd make sense if your major is undecided. OTOH if your application points toward CS but you put English as your major, that might raise an eyebrow.
6. **You don't have to be a "pointy" applicant.** The way he talked about various things made it seem like he doesn't really care whether you're pointy or not. It's just another thing about your folder-- not good nor bad.
7. **Stanford doesn't compare you with applicants from your school.** He said he doesn't even pay attention to your school name outside of ensuring they're evaluating you holistically. I'm curious how true that is... does that mean Stanford doesn't have feeder schools? I'm doubtful.
8. **Stanford uses your 5 words to summarize who you are-- something to tie your whole application together.** \[For context, my AO opened up the call by summarizing all of my region's applicants in 5 words. And yes, it was cheesy af\] Someone asked, "what's the point of the 5 words?". And his response was, "just like I did for y'all \[STATE\] admits, the 5 words are meant to give you an overarching picture of you as a whole." So my/his advice is to make your 5 words like a *title* for your whole Stanford app, or a really short summary. Take this advice with a grain of salt, though, as you should do with every piece of advice you get about this process.
9. **Stanford (or at least my AO) hates when people go over the 5 words limit.** To use his exact words, my AO "cringes" when he sees an applicant break the 5-word rule. However he did say that it's not an automatic reject, noting that many on the call went over 5 words.
10. **There is no most important essay.** He was very clear throughout that there is no most-important thing on the application, including the essays. He said all the essays don't mean much by themselves, it's them all together that's important. He also said there are some applicants whose Roommate Essay was vital to their application, while for others' it was their Intellectual Vitality Essay. It's all case-by-case, and in context with everything else in your folder.
11. **The interview can and can not be important.** Like I said above, it's important for some and not for others. If your interview report brings up something new about you, it might be more important. If it was just a generic report, it doesn't change much.
12. **Stanford really appreciates people who have fun with their responses.** He started the call off with reading snippets of some of his favorite responses to the Stanford short questions. I noticed that every single one he chose to share were all non-serious, fun responses. He didn't share responses about how we want to take this class or meet this professor at Stanford, but how one of us wanted to be the Stanford Tree and another one of us wanted to prank Berkeley during the Big Game Week. My advice: for at least a couple Stanford essays, have fun. The light-hearted responses clearly made more of an impact on him.
13. **Stanford reads every application cover to cover.**
14. **Stanford doesn't super super care about a well-rounded class.** Someone implicitly asked this in the form of "do you keep track of admits on a spreadsheet to ensure diversity?". My AO said no. So Stanford really does just admit people that intrigue them the most-- there are no quotas on majors, interests, background, etc.

## [What do I say to my depressed friend who thinks he HAS to go to an Ivy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cj5yor/what_do_i_say_to_my_depressed_friend_who_thinks/)
He's only applying to Ivies and Oxford. He's convinced he won't get in because self esteem issues, but he's also convinced that he needs the prestige of a name brand school in order to validate his worth as a "smart" person (which he feels is his only good quality).

I've tried telling him that he's smart even without the brand, but he just tells me that he needs it for his ego (he's also convinced he is arrogant, despite being a very humble person). I don't know what to do for him. I almost feel like he needs to fail on his own to see that he doesn't need an Ivy, but I seriously think he might consider offing himself if he doesn't get in.

## [PSA: As you enter college, Please give the weird and awkward kids a chance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cb4eez/psa_as_you_enter_college_please_give_the_weird/)
So, I always was someone with a non traditional quirky personality and a VERY non traditional past. Well as a result, kids ran away from me and looked down on me. It got pretty hopeless. I became a loner who has a hard time finding people who will even give me a chance to this day. I never fit into any group. Im Spanish but didnt mesh with Spanish kids and I realized i was bi bit didnt fit into the touchy LGBT community at school... So going into college as a non traditional student I and many awkward kids or weird kids are scared of not fotting in to the point of some us are bitter amd may seem a bit distant or angry due to our past but I beg of ypu to please give us a chance. We won't bite you and we are fun to be around with interesting ideas when givem the chance!
Thank you.

If I didn't apply to US colleges, I would not have known that New York City and New York are two different things, Washington DC is not in Washington, the east coast and the west coast are actually far away (I didn't realized US is 30x bigger than my country), Canada is somehow between Alaska and the rest of the US, the Northern Midwest is actually cold af, there's a weird number of states that have a square or rectangular border, Ohio exists and is actually in the Midwest although Pennsylvania which is in the east coast is literally right next to ohio, ~~Wyoming does not exists~~ and now I'm committing to a university in Ohio for Fall!

I know it's not important but I just wanna share that with you guys.

Edit: I just found out that it's all Ohio.

## [I console my mom after every rejection](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fq7izv/i_console_my_mom_after_every_rejection/)
Every time I get rejected (or accepted), my mom is sitting in the living room waiting for me to tell her how it went. And every time I get rejected/waitlisted, she becomes on the verge of tears. It's not like a typical Asian parent "my kid's a failure, what will I tell my friends whose kids got into MIT" kind of tears; it's a "my kid worked so hard and I really wanted him to be happy and get in" cry. Then I go over to her and assure her I'm not too sad so she feels better.

It's so sweet. I love my mom. Her reactions are far better than mine: she starts jumping and screaming when I get accepted. I wish I had made a "Mom college decision reaction" video because it's so funny and heartwarming to watch her react to my decisions.

There‚Äôs a company in my town that deals with selling relics and rare objects and basically my school counsellor talked about me to them and they called me up. They have hundreds of old books from the 17-19th century and what they want me to do is research on each individual book and kind of dig up on its history and what edition it is etc and write an overview. I also have to update their website about the condition of the books (eg if there‚Äôs water damage, torn/missing pages) I thought it sounded pretty cool and I‚Äôll be able to learn a lot and make my summer productive but I‚Äôve never heard of an internship like this.I feel like I could  mention it in my EC‚Äôs while applying. Is it worth going for?

Edit: woah I didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up! Thank you guys so much for the feedback and positivity, I‚Äôm so excited to start this tomorrow! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## [UNPOPULAR OPINION : Being accepted to a T20 doesn't make you an expert on college admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fuzm72/unpopular_opinion_being_accepted_to_a_t20_doesnt/)
Title is basically self-explanatory. I have followed the whole stat video/college reaction video genre for a while and though I believe they are largely unhealthy (story for a different time), I felt that in the past these had a decent amount of good information. Recently, however, this category of "influencers" has exploded. Especially with platforms like Tik Tok and Youtube, it seems quite literally everyone who gets into an Ivy+ has the "SECRET FORMULA ON HOW TO GET INTO A T20!!!" Here are some of my favorite soundbites...


**"What really got me into x university was..."** - You literally have NOTHING to back this statement up. Unless you talked to your admission officer personally, you do not have any clue as to what got you into the university you chose. It is misleading and disingenuous to talk as though you have some secret insight into what made your application special. It is even worse when said person has a 1600 SAT and 2-gen legacy, and they then go on to say that their 300 word supplemental about learning how to swim is what got them into Stanford. Are you kidding?

**"What really matters is having good essays and extracurriculars!"** - I completely agree with this point. The problem is who doesn't already know this? Who are the kids who think that academics are literally everything? You look up one guide on college admissions and it is probably the first thing on the list. Why do people think it is such a secret that you should "focus on your extracurriculars!"?

**"I got into x school with a 25th percentile SAT, so you can too!"** - This just isn't true, and is one of my biggest gripes. It seems that these influencers want to think that college admission is this 100% holistic process and test scores are just some red herring. It usually turns out that said vlogger either has an extremely extenuating background or S-tier extracurriculars. If you think that you can get into an Ivy with a 1210 because you "write nice," I have bad news. Statistics don't lie. For everyone with a 25th percentile SAT, there are 3 other people at the same universities with a better score.

More and more it seems like these admission-influencers are really not so much interested in actually helping and more so interested in bragging about their achievements (HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD PART 1????) and spouting meaningless talking points they have heard from others. These types of vids used to be so beneficial but now it seems every video sounds the same. Literally. Turn on two of your stereotypical "HOW I GOT INTO X UNIVERSITY" videos right now. Tell me their points aren't identical. I'll summarize it right now: "Start your ~unique~ essays early. Have continuity in your application. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Demonstrate interest in your school." That is it.

 It is so sad to see people who go to truly amazing universities produce content that is so blatantly braggadocious and above all completely unimaginative. It is even more sad to think that kids who don't know better will follow this often misleading advice and start idolizing ivies for no other reason than a cool name.

## [Don't look at other's life through a lens](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d8p2ag/dont_look_at_others_life_through_a_lens/)
YouTube. Instagram. Twitter. Social media provides a filtered view of our friends and peers ‚Äîthe good shines through while the bad stays hidden. This can make us feel as if everyone is happier than we are, as if we‚Äôre the only ones with problems, and as if our problems can‚Äôt be solved. Social media is a game that hooks us with a constant stream of information but allows us  to undermine our own dignity through constant comparison of lives and ruthless competition for attention. That‚Äôs a recipe for stress, anxiety and depression. The fact is that there is a mental-health crisis on college campus.  One recent study finds that the rate of moderate to severe depression among U.S. college students rose from 23.2% in 2007 to 41.1% in 2018,  while rates of moderate to severe anxiety jumped from 17.9% in 2013 to 34.4% in 2018.

So don't compare your life constantly with only the best of others‚Äô lives. Yesterday a Harvard student posted  [Guys college is super chill, so much better than HS](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d8dce8/guys_college_is_super_chill_so_much_better_than_hs/). There is another side of the story like  [The Unspoken Reality Behind the Harvard Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs). In fact, WGBH Boston reported last week that between 2007 and 2017, [nine Harvard undergraduates in Massachusetts took their own lives](https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2019/09/16/as-student-suicides-rise-a-harvard-case-opens-new-questions-about-schools-responsibility).

## [You have two types of teachers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/elknz5/you_have_two_types_of_teachers/)
So I asked my AP Calc teacher for a college application more than a month ago and he still has not done it yet.

I have reminded him countless times that they were supposed to be due on the 1st but nope still nothing.

Also keep in mind that:

1. He only teaches maybe 3-4 classes, meaning he has 4-5 free periods
2. Every time I've asked him, he tells me "he'll do it by the end of the day"

So instead, I email my microbiology teacher from last year who:

1. Is in another country currently (the country doesn't have the best wifi either)
2. I emailed through a school email (WHY IS THIS MAN CHECKING HIS SCHOOL EMAIL ON VACATION!!)

and he completes it in three days.

&#x200B;

WHAT THE HECK!

I just saw the stats for class of 22 and only 53% of Brown admits and 60% of Cornell came from public schools... The ratio of applicants has to be much different from that, right? People can talk about AA and what not but it seems stuff like this is where the inequality & unfairness plays a major factor

## [Tips from a Stanford Interviewer. Answer these and you'll be prepared for any college interview.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dsz86s/tips_from_a_stanford_interviewer_answer_these_and/)
This is what I tell my kids that I  interview each year. And I'm very forthcoming with them from the initial  phone call/text/communication of the "questions" that I ask. They're  not really questions but they are objectives.

Tell me about your background and what you're interested in studying.

(I  personally don't care about why Stanford because you wrote about that  on your app presumably. Most interviewers will care so you need to have a  very solid, specific answer to that which goes beyond the academics but  gets into fit more than anything else.)

Tell  me what's not on your application that you want to share with the  admissions staff. This is your last shot to communicate with them so  make it count. Tell me about additional context or more detail on your  accomplishments or weaknesses. Family circumstances, health issues,  mental health crises, anything. I want it all and the kitchen sink because this is  the gold that helps make you more human to the admissions committee.  This is where we spend most of the time. In my interviews it is 50% of  the interview. We both brainstorm what else we want to add to strengthen  your app.

What are your questions  about Stanford? I tell them that I only answer questions that aren't  googlable so don't be offended if I shoot your question down just move  on to another one. Hint: asking me questions that involve my opinion or  make me think a little bit are useful.

So  I tell my kids everything I've written above to you. Total  transparency. I don't want to know your stats but I do ask where else  you apply because I give them feedback on the culture of those schools  and whether they think it's a fit for them.

I'm  not the norm but I am one of the university's most experienced  interviewers and I have developed my own method that works well for me  and adds something to the application. I hope that others in the future  will follow suit with the transparency aspect.

If  you can answer these confidently you'll be prepared for any college interview.

I  go into it with the attitude of being your advocate rather than another  person to judge you. I want to share my experience and help you as much  as I possibly can and I often stay in touch with my kids forever  regardless of the outcome.

Please comment with any questions or PM me.

## [AITA for having shitty stats and still applying to Harvard](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/czq2ib/aita_for_having_shitty_stats_and_still_applying/)
So my friend called me an showoff today for applying to Harvard even though I don't have great stats. So what I only have a 4.76 out of the maximum 4.8 GPA possible to get at our school, and I only got a 1590 on the SAT. Sure I only founded 3 nonprofits, and have only ever had a meeting with Obama once. I mean, I get it's not that impressive to be the varsity captain of the tennis and cross country team as a freshman, and to be the drum major for the band as a sophmore, but I still feel like I might as well shoot my shot and hope. Other ECs/stats(as if it matters, none of them are that impressive): president of local NHS chapter, DECA state president, NSHS, NMHS, 14 AP classes(5s in all of them), class rank: 1/3000, built a water supply line in the middle east, fluent in 4 living languages and 2 dead ones. Also important to note: Native American first generation college student in a household with an income of -$12000. So, AITA?

A guy at my school who spends his time rating girls, spreading inappropriate pictures, and belittling other people got into Columbia.

A girl who lied about being low income (This girl goes to NYC every month and carries Gucci to school. I also know her family quite well.) just so she could do QuestBridge got into Brown.

A girl who acts like everyone else is stupid and below her (she has called my friend stupid to her face--and not in a joking way) got into MIT.

None of these people were children of donors or were recruited athletes. It makes me angry that shitty people like these get in over people who deserve it.

Just goes to show how screwed this process is. No, I don't believe admissions officers can truly know an applicant's "story" or "personality" or "fit"--and if they claim they can, I call bullshit.

## [Are we sheep?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bws042/are_we_sheep/)
I go to a large, semi-competitive suburban school in the Bay Area, and as application season nears (I'm a rising junior), I'm beginning to realize that I can't stand the people I hang out with. Yes, I'm Asian-American, and most of my friends are Asian-American as well. Yes, I know we place so much emphasis on learning and education and hard work because back home, that was the only chance we had at climbing the opportunity ladder, the only way to ensure stability in life.

And yet, I hate it all. How cheating is rampant at our school, how we've had four major scandals regarding finals being leaked (or stolen) the day before finals day. How we whisper in hushed voices in the back of classrooms, the occasional furtive glance at a senior, about Emma--*she got into Harvard;* about Bryan, who *didn't deserve to get into MIT;* about William, *how is he even valedictorian? He only got into Berkeley.* How we can never be happy for other people's achievements. It's always arched eyebrows, did your parents get you it you're not even good at law/medicine/coding you're not even going into law/medicine/coding that's totally useless doesn't mean anything when it comes to college admissions but yo mate, can you hit me up?

Earlier last week, my friend walked up to me and asked, "So, are you smarter, or is John?" and I didn't know how to respond. I mean, there were so many things I could have said: you can't distill intelligence into smart, less smart, not smart; we're more than the sum of our grades and extracurriculars; how the hell do you measure that? But I didn't say any of it, just shrugged.

It's not uncommon to hear students disparaging "smart" seniors who hadn't gotten into "top" schools. When did we start to measure someone's worth in the number of T10s they were accepted to? But, hearing the comment about Bryan, I guess it's not just those who don't get into good colleges; even HYPMS-bound students aren't immune. It's just--I don't know. I can't stand it, all the toxicity and competition surrounding college admissions. When did we decide that the ultimate factor in how kind/interesting/influential/smart you are is what college you attend?

We're so shallow. Superficial. Packaging ourselves in pretty, sparkly Christmas wrapping, embellished with a perfectly-tied ribbon and a note card that plays at altruism. Part of the problem is college counselors, all the rage right now because *look!* I'm both *rich* and *Ivy-bound*. Here's a list of everything you need to do to demonstrate your interest in political science, to develop a spike: join MUN, Debate, Youth & Government, Mock Trial, TPUSA. Found a Democrats/Republicans club, MUN club at the middle schools, Debate club at the middle schools. Do the UN summer program, the Senate Page Program, YYGS PLE, the other pre-collegiate programs that offer a politics course. Take a mission trip to Africa and bring the people clean water. Organize a book-giving service to impoverished children in Laos. Check, check, check. Nothing more than a checklist, that, when completed, will realize all of your Ivy League dreams. For a second, the admissions officers are fooled.

So we lose the spark that drives us to change the world for the better, or maybe we never really had it. And even if we're truly passionate about a subject, and we do get into T10s, what happens after? Sell-out culture. Starry-eyed freshmen wanting to be human rights lawyers like Amal Clooney, now going on to law school and working at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, and Katz. Others can't resist the allure of six figures at Goldman Sachs.

I don't know where I'm going with this post, only that I think the high school/college/higher education system is very much flawed. We aren't better people. We're just good sheep.

Literally at my own high school:

\- Friend got rejected/waitlisted at UIUC, UW-Madison, and Purdue, but got into WashU

\- Friend got rejected/waitlisted at Georgia Tech, UW-Madison, and UNC, but was accepted early into USC as a merit scholarship finalist

\- I got rejected by Caltech, UChicago, and WashU, but got into MIT

\- Someone else got rejected/waitlisted by UIUC, WashU, and Case Western, but got a Cornell likely letter (wow!)

&#x200B;

There's literally no way to predict what the admissions committee at any school is going to do with you until you actually open the decision letter. Even if you've gotten mostly or even all rejections so far, don't be too scared of Ivy Day or any other upcoming decision dates -- every single school is independent, and as long as you've applied to schools in a remotely smart way, things are much more likely than not to work out. Stay positive!

People often tell me my life sounds like a movie.... Now that I think about it, it really does lol.

&#x200B;

So my parents have never been supportive of my college education. I got into a university that was really nice during my senior year of high school, and they didn't want me going there at all. I was only 17 at the time, so I didn't have the option to take out loans without a cosigner, and my parents refused. So .. I had to turn down the offer and start at my local community college. The only positive to this was that I got to go for free lol.

I'm at community college now, and I applied to several schools crossing my fingers that I would get in. I worked my ass off to make sure that I didn't get anything less than an A in all of my classes. I also got a credit card to establish a credit history for myself so that I could be eligible to take out loans (if I need to) for university. My parents think that I will be doing the nursing program at my community college, but I will really be transferring to a university. I had to lie to my parents about why I had to have a credit card because they got suspicious.

Fast forward a couple months later, I received the acceptance letter that changed everything. My top university accepted me into their nursing program. I could not believe it. In my eyes, I was just an average student, and I doubted that I would have got in, but I did. I also ended up getting a scholarship that covers all of my tuition and books. I would only need to get loans for the dorm. I know that people say that "loans are the devil" and everything, but this is an investment for my education, and I know it will pay off in the end.

My parents do not know that I got into this university nor do they know that I am planning on leaving. I know 110% that they would not support me going, and may even do everything that they can to stop me. I will leave when my parents aren't home and get a ride/bus to the university on moving day. I do feel kind of bad about doing this, but I do hope that they will understand why I did this with time.

I'm posting this for all of those people who have no support from anyone with trying to get your education. It's not easy at all, and there were several times where I felt like giving up, but you can do it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you everyone! I never thought I was going to get such a big response! I really appreciate everyone's support :)

Just got my appeal decision. Ended up at $26,000/year in scholarship. I'm grateful, but I just can't afford to pay the other $49k. It's been great seeing all of you strive higher and achieve all sorts of incredible things. Maybe I'll be luckier next time. Til then I'll be leaving the college bubble. Thanks for everything A2C <3

  EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: Thank you for all the lovely responses!! And I agree that it's fucked up that even with over $100k in total scholarship I couldn't possibly pay for college in America. It sucks.

To be clear though, I'm International. While it really stings that I can't go to my dream school despite getting in, I am by no means out of options. There are affordable schools here that I can go to, and overall my situation is one of privilege. I'm not looking at "proper" colleges tho, hence my wording.

 I didn't expect so many people to chime in and offer support (you are all lovely, did you know that?) so I wasn't as clear as I should've been at first! My heart goes out to everyone who is unable to pay for a college education and doesn't have other options readily available. It's a fucked up system. I hope you know that you are amazing nonetheless.

I got a 35 ACT last year, and my parents pushed me to take the SAT even though I think a 35 is fine. I got a 1550 and they yelled at me because its a "terrible score". I even have 3 perfect subject test scores and a 4.0. They're even more mad because I went to the football game last night, and I don't have "good priorities" and I just "party all day" (I have like 4 friends and have been to like 3 parties). They want me to quit piano to focus more on college, even though it's one of my strongest ECs and I actually enjoy it. I literally have all my early applications done (and have some of my RD ones done too), but they want me to lock myself in my room and "do college apps". Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

I've scrolled through so many posts on here with people being excited about going to school or committing or getting in. and then someone asks, "what school?" and this person says the school (and it isn't a T20) and then feels a need to rationalize why they are excited.

GUYS!

we shouldn't be making anyone feel insecure about where they're going or where they want to go. so many people don't get a shot a college and even fewer are ever offered the opportunity to attend. let's make this a space where everyone can be proud of where they are going off to college whether that be ivy or a local community college.

Just the fact that you're into a college or committed or whatever is  AMAZING . do not let the jealous angry people on here make you feel less than. and to that jealous person, grow up. no one wins anything from anyone's loss.

# Activities Section:

novembrr's activities series is so useful:

* [Stuck on your activities list? Novembrr can help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6uig01/stuck_on_your_activities_list_novembrr_can_help/) (Comment replies give helpful examples of how to phrase ECs)

* [What you should do if you have no ECs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6eg8jq/what_you_should_do_if_you_have_no_extracurricular/)

u/MrsScholarGrade's series is new, and I hope I'll be adding more of her great work:

* [What counts as an EC, anyway?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cls7c1/faq_what_counts_as_an_ec_anyway/)
* [Activities and Awards: Making the Most of Your Character Count](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cky9bl/activities_and_awards_making_the_most_of_your/)

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bydczc/list_of_competitions_and_programs_to_pursue_to/) links several resources to find competitions/programs for your ECs or to find ECs based on your academic interest! I don't think you should be basing your activities on prestigious awards, but if you *are* doing something and you want to find ways to get more involved or get rewarded, this is a good resource.

## [The absolute stupidest essay that got my friend into Carnegie Mellon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpknny/the_absolute_stupidest_essay_that_got_my_friend/)
Proof that going full tweak gets u into genius schools

Prompt:
Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to emphasize about your application for the admission committee's consideration? Highlight something that's important to you or something you haven't had a chance to
share. Tell us, don't show us (no websites please).

Response:
One thing I would like to emphasize that is extremely important to me is my intense disdain for everything Andrew Carnegie stood for. As a person who believes that the American Dream should be accessible to everyone who is willing to work for it, Carnegie's actions in the American steel industry could never be justified in my eyes.

Andrew Carnegie was the son of a humble immigrant steelworker. Never would any respectable person ever expect him to be the monster he inevitably became. "Robber baron" does not begin to describe the total absence of decency in any corner of his empty criminal soul. He mercilessly monopolized American steel and destroyed the lives of the American middle-class.

I strongly believe in the idea that businesses should not be able to monopolize an industry as it gives them too much control over the lives of the people who require the resources it produces. As such l can only condemn Andrew Canegie as a man, despite his contributions to social welfare through his building of libraries and schools. While his legacy may be greater
than just his worst qualities, his despicable actions and crimes against the common American
man were too much to forgive. His workers were underpaid and worked in horrible conditions.
His brutal exploitation of his workforce was all to only contribute to building the monstrous steel
throne that Carnegie attempted to build for himself.

Regardless of my undying loathing for Andrew Carnegie, I do not wish to live at odds
with any person, living or dead. I would hope that by attending the university Carnegie founded
over 100 years ago I can reconcile my differences with the Ghost of Andrew Carnegie, and I
could once again be at peace with the word.

Class of 2020,

The time of the highly coveted regular decisions has come. As we all get into various colleges, please know that getting rejected from a dream college isn‚Äôt the end of the road! Going to a good college is great, but what you make of the four years is more important!

Now, once March is over, all the juniors will be flooding in to this subreddit, and with that, we can‚Äôt help but think how far we made it in this college application journey. No matter which school you are going to, Congratulations to everyone in the Class of 2020 for making it past this grueling journey.

And now, Good Luck to the Class of 2021!!!

## [A Declaration of Independence against the Collegeboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/exvs5i/a_declaration_of_independence_against_the/)
 When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for students to protest the injustices imposed on them by an oppressive organization, they must declare the causes which motivate them to the protest.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all students have the right to sanity, not getting ripped off, and decent educational standards. That, whenever any organisation in control of students becomes destructive to these ends, then it becomes reasonable to protest their injustices. To prove this, let us state the facts of this organization.

1. The cost for the SAT is $47.50. **$47.50** to take a multiple choice test
2. Hardly any multiple choice tests are released to students to study from. My calc teacher makes new tests and quizzes EVERY YEAR
3. In order to gain access to questions, students must buy books CREATED by the college board so they make money
4. The president of the college board, a non profit organization, made 1.3 MILLION in 2009. Over twice sal khan's salary at khan academy and more than the Red Cross president salary.
5. For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products
6. For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to sent scores. To send a number
7. To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to send a financial aid report (the irony). Meanwhile the FAFSA is completely free
8. Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from student money
9. For having multiple reporting errors in their [process](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqbkfe/fuck_the_college_board/)
10. Having to pay $98 dollars to go through an AP exam (3 hours of death)
11. In addition to these $98, students have to pay for study materials due to lack of resources posted online
12. For playing mind games with students (you can send your score to 4 colleges for free before you get your score report or pay to send to colleges after you get your scores????? What??)
13. For selling student data [College Board Search ‚Äî Pricing and Payment Policies](https://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/licensing/pricing-payment-policies) without making them sufficiently aware [The College Board's Student Privacy Pledge Status ‚Äì Pledge to Parents & Students](https://studentprivacypledge.org/the-college-boards-student-privacy-pledge-status/)
14. Recycling SAT exams allowing for cheating
15. Rush shipping is an extra $15. So they can ship it early but they don‚Äôt just to milk money

In every stage we have petitioned to our oppressors, yet they have not answered our complaints.

But it‚Äôs over now, I‚Äôm a senior now going to college next year where I won‚Äôt get ripped off with useless bloated costs. Oh wait‚Ä¶

## [Honest Opinion: Stop comparing yourself to everyone else here and BE PROUD of what you've done](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/crfwtl/honest_opinion_stop_comparing_yourself_to/)
I see it all the time. "Oof, guys, I only have a 3.9 GPA" or "Fuckk, not a 1530 *again!"* and so many things to this degree.

Guys, I can assure you that your accomplishments are *impressive,* to say the least. My high school doesn't even have AP classes, my 1280 SAT is one of the higher scores here, and years of meddling and mediocrity has given me the gift of a 3.38 unweighted GPA.

Even then, with all the mistakes I've made, and all the opportunities I have skipped, every "what if" that has pulsed through my mind stronger than ever, I still feel proud of what I have done. I know that past me had his own issues, and a huge lack of drive, which is where I am today. I have used my past to make future me the best he can be! As we go into senior year, I find myself getting ready for a 4.0 GPA this year, with lots of studying for the SAT in December to get it as good as it can be!

So let's just try and be a little more proud of our past selves, ok? Everyone is different and has their own *labryinths* of problems and obstacles to overcome, and that is fine! The goal isn't to see constantly look around and ask if you are above your peers while praying to the gods you'll get into a T20. You need to be doing *your* best, whatever that is for you. If your best is 3.1 GPA and 950 SAT, that's fine! In the words of our lord Simon, make sure you scream and kick and fight like hell before admitting defeat.

Among the simplest things you can do and 100% will benefit from, these:
- Start our Common App account, fill in the info
- Start your CSS profile, fill in the info - ESPECIALLY my international comrades, it's a pain in the ass to know what all that long-ass list of Americanisms convert to (hint: most other countries have no benefits)
- Start your CA essay, maybe even make 2 to have more choices
- Start your "Why Major" and "Elaborate on an EC" supplements. Around 200 words
- Look for the particular programs that you'll want to mention in your probable "Why us" essay

I‚Äôm tired of all these people trying to weigh the benefits of ED, saying they ‚Äúneed‚Äù the boost and they‚Äôll just back out citing poor aid if they get in somewhere better. That‚Äôs not only risky as fuck, but shitty to everyone involved. It‚Äôs ridiculous that these posts come up time and time again.

ED HAS A PURPOSE. Don‚Äôt abuse it and don‚Äôt come on here presenting this whole dilemma of how you need someone to convince you to ED when your instincts were correct the first time: you‚Äôre nervous because you shouldn‚Äôt ED. ED is not meant for you because you‚Äôre not certain about your choice.

ED is not this magical, get out of jail free ‚Äúboost‚Äù that you can just deploy at whim. The decision of whether to ED is cut and dry. ED is for the kids who have been dreaming about this school for months, years, who‚Äôre dead certain they‚Äôll go no matter who else accepts them.

I don‚Äôt care if I get downvoted to hell, I‚Äôm right.  EDing when you‚Äôre still uncertain about a school is shady as fuck.

Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of high school. They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview. As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)

Edit: thank u all for helping this become my most upvoted post ever :)

## [Getting off the admissions train](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fr7rc9/getting_off_the_admissions_train/)
 Just over 40 hours ago, I got my last college result, a rejection from Rice, which was my top choice. Moments ago, I submitted my last waitlist responses and application updates.

As of now, I have officially disembarked the college admissions train.

I‚Äôll be honest: to some extent, I am disappointed in my results. With only 3 acceptances, I either got rejected or waitlisted by all my supposed match schools, not to mention reaches. The only shred of honor I have left is not giving in to the temptation to shotgun, although I still feel somewhat cheated for spending almost 2K USD through the whole process, from taking standardized exams as an international, to sending in application fees and official score reports.

But I digress.

The point isn't how I didn't live up to my expectations, or my parents' expectations, or my friends' expectations. This is dedicated to every one of you out here who survived the process in one piece, and a reflection of what I've become after walking out of this mess.

As clich√© as it sounds, the college application process did make me grow. I acknowledged ideals I had buried for so long, and conjured dreams I didn‚Äôt dare to make. I knew that I wanted to do something artsy and related to computer science, but it wasn‚Äôt until I was writing Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat constitutes your ideal college experience‚Äù prompt that I truly drew up a roadmap. It wasn‚Äôt until I was researching universities that I learned Berkeley had a lab for jumping spiders, and I was reminded of how, as a kid, I‚Äôd always thought I‚Äôd study entomology. Some part of me still does.

I was rejected from my top choices, yes, but it‚Äôs not too late for me to start writing domestic university applications with renewed perspectives and a now-streamlined resume.

That‚Äôs not to say the process was all fun and games.

In a sense, I also hate who the college application season has made me become, and every day I have to remind myself to stay true. I hate how the competition has made me jealous of some of my best friends, and how it's made some of my best friends depressed. I hate how we have to wake up every day thinking about how we've been quantified and scrutinized, or maybe not scrutinized enough. I hate how the toxicity has brought some of us to a breaking point, then we're disposed of, as if a piece of paper with either "Congratulations!" or "I'm sorry" can blow us off.

Yet when I look at this sub, with all our insecurities on full display and memes vying for the front page, I'm happy about how it has brought so many of us together. We and we alone wear our special shade of bleary eyes from calculating our chances based on years of admissions data. We and we alone know the stress of waiting, the relief of getting into at least a safety, the pain of having a dream squashed upon opening our student portals. That‚Äôs why we support each other like a true family with roots across the world. I've received essays worth of condolences and encouragement from so many friends, and I'm not lying when I say I got closer to crying while reading them than any rejection.

Remember the immortal tale of a guy trying to kiss his Yale interviewer? Remember calling UChicago UC Hicago? Remember late-night essay cramming, remember caffeine boosts, remember how when Greta Thunberg made the news, we joked that she'd be proud of how we were recycling our supplements? I do. These are the common memories that tided me over strained relationships and insecure chancemes throughout the process. I wouldn't dump them even if it meant getting my pick of colleges.

It's been a long day, and I‚Äôm starting to ramble incoherently, so I‚Äôll cut this short. I‚Äôm glad to be off the college admissions train at last, but I do not regret buying my ticket onboard. I did not get to take this train to my station of choice, but along the ride, I‚Äôve met so many fellow passengers who have made it more than worth the price. Geniuses, overachievers, depressed teens, you, me‚Ä¶we‚Äôre all worth infinitely more than any college thinks.

It‚Äôs been an honor, A2C. To hell with decisions, just getting to know you guys is good enough for me.

Your high school gpa is not part of the criteria for med school, for law school, for landing that dank job at a social media business, for creating some phenomenal music that takes off and moves the world, or for being happy. My friends, take a breather for a minute and just think how lucky we are to live in a world where we can truly create our own opportunities from almost nothing. all love

## [The 2020 r/A2C Census](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g9ci9q/the_2020_ra2c_census/)
Hey, guys! Now that we're about done with the college application process, I wanted to make a comprehensive survey for the class of 2020/2024. It asks some questions about demographics, stats, college results, and financial aid, and takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. You'll be able to see the results of the poll after you submit your form.

**You can take it [here](https://forms.gle/bqiLX6mceUWq9E6f6).**

Please only take it if you 1) are a graduating senior or transfer student this year and 2) have already received your admissions decisions/know where you will be attending school next year. I will make a post later on sharing the results for the underclassmen.

Edit: Also, guys, most of the demographics questions are optional, so if you don‚Äôt want to mention your sexuality/religion/political affiliation, you can just skip the question instead of putting some smart ass answer in the ‚Äúother‚Äù. I‚Äôll have to delete your entire response if you put an inappropriate answer to these questions, and I don‚Äôt want to have to do that.

Edit 2: I have made some changes to the survey, including adding more colleges to the list. You should be able to edit your submission, but if you can't, please don't submit a second response.

I also realize that it's not the most user-friendly form, but there's not much I can do to make it easier. I'd recommend completing it on a computer rather than on mobile, and using ctrl+F to find the schools you're looking for. The data for the "College List" section is a trainwreck, but I'll be publishing the results in a better format later on.

Thank you for taking the time to fill this out! :)

Just know that you don‚Äôt always need college to advance in life. Your grit will advance you by itself.

I want to say, do ECs that really excite you and you like doing. That four years of highschools isnt nothing. If you use it to develop yourself, it‚Äôs the perfect opportunity to pursue you interest while you are not expected to. Thats four years of experience that you may get ahead of others

## [Extremely inappropriate interviewer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f148vp/extremely_inappropriate_interviewer/)
Sorry if this post comes off like word vomit but I need to get this off my chest because I haven‚Äôt told anyone about it yet. I had my Dartmouth interview a couple days ago with a man who was probably 50 years older than me and he was being really inappropriate the entire time. We met in a Starbucks. He complimented me multiple times on my outfit, jewelry, hair, and was very insistent on telling me about the social scene at Dartmouth. I would try to ask about academics or atmosphere and he would steer the conversation back to what the dating scene was like there. He told me to ‚Äústay safe at frat parties because God knows what those boys would do to a girl like you.‚Äù He asked me if I was part Asian and when I said yes he said his girlfriend during his junior year was Asian. During the interview, he would put his hand on my knee/thigh and keep it there for a minute. He was also constantly staring at my chest. When it was finally over he said he wanted to walk me back to my car and I said that‚Äôs okay I need to use the bathroom and he said he would wait for me. I didn‚Äôt want him to say I was rude on his review of me so I just washed my hands and let him walk me to my car with his hand on my lower back the whole time.

The entire time I just felt like he was too close to me, he was practically breathing down my neck at one point. He wouldn‚Äôt stop touching me even though I would shrink away from it, and he wouldn‚Äôt answer any of my questions. After I saw him drive away I just sat in my car and cried for a while. I don‚Äôt know if I can explicitly say it was harassment because I never told him to stop touching me or to stop looking at my breasts but I still feel so disgusting knowing he was looking at me like I‚Äôm just a slab of meat.

He knows my name, email, and my phone number and probably lots of other information about me. At multiple times throughout the interview he said he was good friends with lots of people in the admissions office so I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs gonna say something bad about me if I report it. I also just want it to be over, I don‚Äôt ever want to have to see him or talk about him again. I have no proof that he was harassing me. I feel like if I report it they‚Äôre gonna ask for proof which I don‚Äôt have, or they‚Äôre going to ask me what I was wearing, or just ignore me. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm getting really upset again thinking about it. Have any other girls had a similar experience? Boys, too?

Edit: I‚Äôve sent an email with help from u/ScholarGrade and others. Thank you all for the encouraging me to say something and if this happens to you you should as well. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to remember your principles when you‚Äôre caught in an uncomfortable situation, but there is nothing wrong with asking someone to stop touching you. Again, thank you all

I feel like I've done so much stuff in high school that I've pained myself to endure, receiving many awards and accolades the past four years only to go to community college. I really don't understand how a couple more B's and 100-200 points less on the SAT's than my peers will offset my chances of attending UCLA or Berkeley. Before anyone says that it's completely FiNe to go to a CC the first two years, I just want to put you guys in my shoes where I get to see everyone else celebrating about going to Yale, Brown, or Berkeley while I have to wait another two years. I finished with getting my IB Diploma, NHS, CSF, Junior Civitan, Marching band with over 400+ hours yet that still isn't enough??  I don't understand and I feel like a complete failure.

I would have talked to my friends about our memories and lives instead of which colleges we got rejected from.

I would have told my teachers thank you for being the parental figures I never really had instead of telling them I didn‚Äôt quite feel like doing busy work on that Friday afternoon

Or maybe I would have told some of them how I really felt (like they should actually have been teaching me.)

I would have told my counselor that when she cried when I got into college it was the single most heartwarming moment of my life.

I would have told my old best friend how sorry I was that we drifted apart.

I would have gotten disgusting school lunch one last time just for shits and giggles.

I would have gone to the bathroom and taken in the hideous hot pink (and I love hot pink) hue that the walls were painted.

I would have looked at the trees a little longer and see what fleeting beauty I could capture.

I would have sat with my friends at lunch instead of freaking out to my teacher over impending admissions decisions.

I would have laughed harder, sang more, and never let a smile fall off my face.

I would have savored every moment as if it were time suspended in its own little galaxy.

I would have done everything instead of giving it away.

I would have

I would have

T20 is not a rank. It is not a list. It is not a few of colleges arranged according to their academic strengths.

T20 is an abstract idea, that only true A2C redditors will understood. It spans from Ivies to State universities. A university is a T20 if all true A2C redditors understand in harmony that it is a T20. The subreddit defines the T20. You are the one who defines a T20.

## [Ivy Day is the Anniversary of my Suicide Attempt, and this is what I want to tell you](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fow4w1/ivy_day_is_the_anniversary_of_my_suicide_attempt/)
TW: suicide, psych ward, drugs, arson, emotional abuse

Four years ago today, I was spending my "last" twenty-four hours writing notes to friends and family, and silently saying goodbye to all the things I thought I'd never see again: icicles glistening under the sun. Trees. Honey-nut cheerios. Gel pens. Back then, I couldn't picture myself living another day, much less graduating high school, applying to colleges, or dreaming of a future. But somehow, against the odds, I made it. I made it through the bright lights of the ER, as doctors worked frantically around me sticking IVs in my veins and prodding my face. I made it through the psych ward, living with drug-dealers from juvie and eight year olds who tried to burn down their schools. I made it through months of crushing shame, my parents screaming at me with disappointment, and shrinks who told me that I was a lost cause.

Because here's the thing that I want to say to us--on the eve of Ivy Day, no matter what shit goes down tomorrow and how bitter and disappointed we are with your results--even if it feels like our worlds are collapsing, we'll get through this. This one's for us: for all of those late nights studying APs, IBs, SATs, and ACTs, all those days we were so worn-down from Sports and EC board nominations and friend drama that we fell asleep at our desks, all those moments we ducked into the school bathrooms and thought, *I can't do this*.

Because we've made it. We DID do it. We've already worked so unbelievably hard and have come so unbelievably far, and even if we aren't rewarded tomorrow, we've already won. Those flimsy paper "regret to inform you"s? They are NOTHING compared to what we've accomplished and how hard we've worked. They do not define us. They do not summarize four years of tears and sweat and grit. They will never know our full stories and how much we've overcome.

So this is the beginning of a lifetime, not the end of a journey.

If you get into your dream school? Congrats! But you're still going to have to work hard these next four. If you get rejected? Congrats! It's now a chip on your shoulder to keep busting ass. We are so young. We are SO young. We are seventeen and eighteen and nineteen and bursting with promise, and as long as we work hard, stay hungry, and learn as much as we can with what we're given, we're going to succeed and we're going to be happy.

Whatever happens tomorrow is the universe's plan for you. Before you open that first decision, take a moment to reflect, to be proud of all you've done and everything you've become. No matter what happens next, you are ready.

Saddle up.

&#x200B;

\*update: I'm so moved by all of your comments and support! Feeling beyond grateful for the a2c community.

## [I was accepted by Harvard 15 years ago. On Ivy Day, hear my application story and take my advice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpcav2/i_was_accepted_by_harvard_15_years_ago_on_ivy_day/)
Before decisions come out today, I want to share my TEDx talk on my Harvard journey ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs)) and share more stories that I didn't mention in the TEDx talk. The video, especially, should alleviate some of your stress as you anxiously wait for your college results today.

**tl;dr**: It's really okay to not get into an Ivy League school, because a college name is not what life is about.

&#x200B;

**== My Application ==**

If I put my stats in r/chanceme, people will say I'm probably a T30 student at best, and I agree:

* Asian-American not from a rich or famous family
* A sub-1500 SAT score: I had only a 1450 SAT (converted from 2180 on the old SAT)
* Not ranked top 7 in my class
* Only 2 AP scores when I applied (and 3 APs in senior year), one of which was a 4
* Never had individual awards with a scope that is larger than regional/NYC (our math team, of which I was the team captain, won joint-first places in competitions like American Regional and NYC Interscholastic Math League, and I won 4 personal medals with our school team in two prelim rounds of science olympiad in NYC
* Didn't start anything, didn't publish papers, didn't have internships
* I was over 1 hour late to my interview (granted, there was a snowstorm, and my interviewer arrived 5 minutes after I, but still...)

The top of my college list was MIT, Cornell, Caltech, and Stanford. Harvard was not on my "list" because I never doubted that my chance of getting in was 0%, so I spent the least amount of time on my Harvard application. I applied to Harvard just because it was on the common app, it didn't require a dedicated essay, and I wanted to say "I applied to Harvard" to "sound smart."

&#x200B;

**== Ivy Day ==**

I was ecstatic when I came home and saw large envelopes from NYU and Columbia. Large envelopes meant acceptance with brochures and everything, while small envelopes meant a "thank you but this year was competitive" rejection letter. However, I had my mind on Cornell after being waitlisted by MIT, and I was dejected when I later saw my rejection decision from Cornell. Then, An email notification came in: "New email from Harvard College Office of Admissions."

"Oh, I forgot I applied to Harvard. Ha."

I opened the email. It was short. After rereading it about 20 times, I realized I got in. I was the first from my high school over the past 4+ years.

&#x200B;

**== Results and Decision ==**

I was turned down from the top 4 schools on my list, as well as Washington University in St. Louis, but I got into Harvard, NYU Stern, Columbia, Tufts. When I shared my good news with our school counselor, I told her I was considering NYU, Columbia, and Tufts, but I was not considering Harvard because it didn't have a good engineering program and it doesn't have a business major. However, I loved Harvard's Pre-Freshmen weekend, and I made my choice for Harvardafterwards.

&#x200B;

**== Harvard years ==**

It's pretty much everything in my TEDx talk, Link again here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs). You should watch at least part of the video before you continue reading.

&#x200B;

**== Post-College and My Life Advice ==**

I want to write this post to echo [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fomnzw/i_got_into_my_dream_ivy_league_school_10_years/) Reddit post from yesterday, because I, too, was unhappy and stressed. After the four years I mentioned in the video, I no longer had suicidal thoughts, but I continued to feel unhappy at times. I am proud of my friends for making TIME and Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, I am happy for my Harvard dance mate to receive mentorship and millions from Mark Cuban on Sharktank, and I brag about being in the same economics class with Jeremy Lin, but until a few years ago, I still felt ashamed that I'm not "at their level" post-college and was afraid that the peak of my life may be the college degree I received a decade ago.

What am most I proud of today? I'm proud that the stress I encountered in college has helped me develop mental toughness; I'm proud that being turned down by top tech, finance, and consulting companies has led to my career today, a "college counseling" company that focuses on mentoring self-development and preaching all of my life lessons; and I'm proud that my stress and disappointment then have led to my happiness today.

**If you get in today:** Congrats on all your hard work! However, if you do decide to go, know that this honor and label will become a responsibility and even a burden for the rest of your life. It will not bring you happiness, money, fame, or success; in fact, with the overly high expectations from an Ivy Leaguer, going to a top school may bring you sadness, breakdown, bad health, and a less-desired future than going to a non-top school. You have worked your butt off all your life to get into an Ivy League degree, but this may be the beginning of your nightmare. I have persuaded some of my students who got into Ivy League schools to attend state schools, and all of them are extremely successful and happy today.

**If you don't get in today:** Just like getting turned down by your crush, you have all the right to cry and feel disappointed for a while. However, consider a few points. First, the stress and competition at a top college are extremely toxic and only those who go through can understand how miserable it is. Next, if you value your career and future success over your college degree, top companies choose students from top schools only because of the people and not of their degrees; if you have the hard and soft skills, you can get into any top company with a T-100 degree, and I'm sure anyone aiming for a T-10 school can get into a T-100 school. Lastly, if you are looking to pursue a post-bachelors degree, getting good grades in a T-100 state school will give you a better chance at getting into an Ivy League grad school than mediocre grades (\~3.5) at a T-10 or T-20, so you may be better off attending a great state school now anyway.

&#x200B;

By the way, those who say "but an Ivy League degree at least increases my chances of finding a good job and being successful in the future!" do not know what they are talking about. I didn't get an offer to any of the top full-time jobs I applied and I'm not alone, while many of my high school friends who went to state schools are extremely successful today. There's a correlation, but not a causation, between a college degree and a good future. The causation is between someone with hard and soft skills and a good future.

Continue working hard, develop good character, and everyone can be an "Ivy Leaguer" in life. Instead of saying "good luck to your college decisions!!!" I'll say "good luck in your future!!!" üòé

&#x200B;

p.s. happy to answer questions or take DM's :-)

Let's take a moment to appreciate what our parents did for us to get to this stage. Even if tomorrow is ivy day, even if it doesn't happen the way you want it to, I want you to remember that you should feel privileged to be able to apply.

Also remember that they are proud of you, even if they don't show it verbally. Think of all those late night snacks they make for you or how hard they work at their job to earn money for your family. An accent is a sign of strength and fearlessness.

Whatever happens tomorrow, they will still support you :)

UCs just dropped test requirements and will go test blind in a few years. Many schools including MIT and Caltech went subject test blind. This year's APs will carry almost no weight in admissions, even less than before. We are finally stepping in the right direction!

Edit: I'm personally not against standardized tests. It's the only thing keeping people from bullshitting their way into top schools. I am just glad that the power is being taken off of collegeboard's hands.

## [Seniors: You need to watch this documentary, especially if you‚Äôre a woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ewuyu5/seniors_you_need_to_watch_this_documentary/)
TW: Sexual assault

I go to an all girls school and every year since 2016, we have shortened day where senior classes are suspended so we can watch The Hunting Ground and have a discussion on it. The Hunting Ground is basically about college‚Äôs and official‚Äôs responses on sexual assault on college campuses. It focuses on institutions such as UNC Chapel Hill, Harvard, Notre Dame, FSU, and more and, for the luck of a better term, their shrugging off of sexual assault claims. I believe every senior who‚Äôs about to start college in the fall watch this documentary and statistics saying between 1 in 4-5 undergraduate women being sexually assaulted on campuses, it‚Äôs especially vital for young women to watch it. It‚Äôll break your heart, piss you off, and give you hope at the same time.

EDIT: According to RAINN, the national assault telephone hotline, [‚ÄúAmong undergraduate students, 23.1% of females and 5.4% of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.‚Äù](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence). However, if RAINN isn‚Äôt enough for you, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center also cites [1 in 5](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) , citing the National Criminal Justice Reference Service


And so what if the stats are lower than one in four or one in five? Hell, we had a panel of speakers after the documentary and one who works for our states largest public university said its predicated at their particular college it‚Äôs one in three. Anyway, it‚Äôs still vital to raise awareness on sexual assault, especially the cover up by colleges across the country.


EDIT 2: Also, I‚Äôve heard the argument that you can‚Äôt look at surveys you have to look at reported rapes. However, assuming the statistic reported in the documentary is correct, 88% of rapes that happen on college campuses are NOT reported. Finally, I‚Äôll leave you with one of the most reliable and recent sources out there. The Association of American Universities released their 2019 sexual conduct and misconduct report in October. 181,000 college students were surveyed. [They found that 26.4% of women reported nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent. ](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf)

## [Please help settle a bet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/frglqb/please_help_settle_a_bet/)
At some point in December, either out of a desire to distract myself from final exams or merely kill time, I set out with a mission: create the most well-crafted, yet absolutely horrendous, Stanford application essays as I possibly could. In retrospect, my exact reasoning for this decision was hazy, but I did it anyway. What astonished me more though than the fact that I had actually written these essays, however, was that many people, people who I rightfully trust, believed that I had made a mistake in not actually applying with the following essays (in text, and also in the Google Doc). Somehow, they believed, like The Producers, this would be a case of "so bad it's good". Some disclaimers:

\-I did not choose to apply to Stanford, both because there would be far better ways for me to waste money and because I wanted to go to a large public school.

\-Academically and in terms of other attributes, I would have been generally qualified; the following essays would most likely be the topic of differentiation, not necessarily anything else. That is irrelevant in this case, however.

\-I hold no personal grudge toward Stanford for any reason, even if I did not/do not believe it was/is the right fit for me.

The question: Are the following essays so terrible/disdainful/weird/whatever else that they would automatically put me out of contention of being accepted to Stanford? Not that they would get me accepted, but I am personally of the belief that these would be immediately disqualifying, while most have argued the exact opposite.

Mods, I do apologize if this is too tangential for this subreddit.

Link to the essays:

 [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XzlZ10cYRlSNaNJiGrUCSJ8pPkljruvWi9z6QEtIwzs/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XzlZ10cYRlSNaNJiGrUCSJ8pPkljruvWi9z6QEtIwzs/)

The essays:

##### Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences. (150 words)

In the middle of my senior year, I was able to exploit an opportunity given generously by my former Chinese teacher to tutor her academically-challenged son in AP Physics. He was ‚Äúslow,‚Äù according to his mother; I had no hope for him. Still, I knew it was my duty to help the less fortunate, those who were not blessed with my above-average comprehension of the material, and for $35 an hour, who could resist? Henceforth, every day in the library I instilled a basic comprehension of rudimentary physics in that boy; to paraphrase Kipling, I was bound in exile to serve my captive‚Äôs need.

As physics is fundamental to the universe, my actions are thus fundamental as well‚Äîthose who build houses for the homeless or cure cancer cannot also boast of their dominion over the universe‚Äôs natural forces. Henceforth, as I counted my $20 bills, I knew true happiness.

##### What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)

Despite my exemplary work ethic, self-effacing charm, and jocular wit, I am not appreciated enough by my peers. Shakespeare wrote, ‚Äúsome are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.‚Äù If I were to thrust my greatness more vigorously upon society, society would henceforth be improved.

##### How did you spend your last two summers? (50 word limit)

During the summer of junior year, I was able to dispense my wisdom to compatriots at UCSC as a parrot disperses fruit seeds through its feces. Last summer, I studied financial accounting, a decision which inspired me to make money through the profession henceforth.

##### What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)

I wish I witnessed the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; with its boundless expanses of sickly ebon, the cacophonous cawing of drowning seabirds, the palpable fear of a thousand Greenpeace hacks, henceforth I would feel even more appreciation for humanity‚Äôs influence on the universe.

##### What five words best describe you? (10 word limit)

Jaded, idiosyncratic, quixotic, perspicacious, equanimous

##### When the choice is yours, what do you read, listen to, or watch? (50 word limit)

I have a recording saved of my eighth-grade graduation, where one of my classmates delivered an appropriately fawning, adulatory paean on my exemplary characteristics. I have treasured that moment, my ‚Äúrosebud,‚Äù if you will, and suitable time has been spent henceforth on reliving that former glory.

##### Name one thing you are looking forward to experiencing at Stanford. (50 word limit)

An environment of peers and professors who will be sophisticated enough to truly appreciate me in my myriad, multifaceted talents; only such a distinguished community of enlightened folks as Stanford will provide the satisfaction I know I deserve. I know henceforth I shall have imparted a once-in-a-lifetime feeling upon them.

##### Imagine you had an extra hour in the day ‚Äî how would you spend that time? (50 word limit).

Appreciating the finer things in life‚Äîthe trilling of birdsong on the patio, Don Jos√©‚Äôs laments in *Carmen*, the luminous radiance of my 500-count bed sheets, authentic tieguanyin from Fujian; this latter gustatory experience has led me to henceforth resolve to enlighten my future peers and broaden their limited horizons.

##### The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)

A fundamental truth which my history teachers have imparted on my eager, young mind is that those who do not study the past are doomed to repeat it. I find this a defeatist perspective: history deserves to be reiterated and expanded upon, its fractal forms reprised through posterity. The prospect of being the vanguard of one of these movements, revitalizing and improving what less innovative minds designed before, titillates me; when I first read of the historical figures of yore, Julius Caesar and Napoleon, I henceforth resolved to do what they were incapable of and remodel the world in a better, more harmonious mold.

This sacred responsibility I have taken upon myself drives my attitude in the classroom: all historical events are fuel for the fire of invention, timber to be sawed together or ground into dust‚ÄîHephaestus‚Äô artistry cannot compare to the mental machinations I must go through to stoke the flames of intellectual development. Those of my peers or my gracious mentors who understand this well-reasoned perspective may once rise above their stolid positions as mere teachers or students, and henceforth join me in a brave new world, and those who do not are doomed to fail. At Stanford, I hope all are of the former group.

##### Virtually all of Stanford‚Äôs undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate ‚Äî and us ‚Äî know you better. (100 to 250 words)

Dear future roommate,

I am excited to meet you, and I know you are excited to meet me. Together, with my guidance, we shall accomplish greatness.

Sometimes, as I lie in blissful contemplation, I ponder what our purpose in the universe is. I believe some are destined to be the Da Vincis and Teslas, tirelessly exerting themselves trailblazing new paths for all of us; others are the shoe-shiners of the world, content in their oyster to live a simple life, unaware of the value pearls provide. I am of the former group, and I hope you are too.

Still, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. We must discuss practical matters too, as I will have plenty of time to exchange my pearls of wisdom with yours. Firstly, you must appreciate opera and jazz, as this is what we will listen to; if you disagree, I will help you see the light. Secondly, I am reserving sole access to our mini fridge, sink, mirror, and shower, as unfettered access to these devices preserves my holistic well-being. You are smart, I am sure, so you will cope well.

Often in life we are tested in times of hardship, and we are defined by how we react. I understand this will be a difficult experience for you, expanding your mental horizons, but at some point henceforth we must all learn to swim in the vast ocean of life. I will then be your pool noodle and help you swim, so do not worry. You are not alone.

Best,

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

##### Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)

I have a pet term for what most would consider mental refinement, pushing the boundaries of the intellect: ‚Äúthinkification.‚Äù This takes many forms in my daily life: I may thinkify when reading Camus‚Äô *The Stranger* or Ibsen‚Äôs *Et Dukkehjem*; I may also thinkify when casually writing poetry (a noble pursuit which like many subjects, I have a natural acuity for). Only a thoroughly thinkified mind could, in the course of its daily dalliances, write such poetry as this ode to soy sauce:

To drink thee in thy inky, ebon form,

Thy flowing drops cascading down my spoon,

The briny fumes a swirling, pounding storm.

My sushi dances through thy dark lagoon,

its salmon, tuna blending into one,

Voracious tides submerging sticky rice;

The bacchanal of feasting has begun!

About this pleasure I‚Äôll remain concise:

When guzzling flasks of saline liquid gold,

Ambrosial darkness meeting shrouded lore,

I wonder why we scorn our friendly mold‚Äî

Oh how I love the aspergillus spore!

If anyone abhors divine soy sauce,

I shake my head and think‚Äîgee, what a loss!

Thinkification is important to me because it best equips me for making the world a better place; only a mind suitably honed on the whetstone of intellectual challenge will develop the vivacity necessary to tackle daily challenges of great importance. Ministers of our intellectual profession like Nietzsche and Kierkegaard may tackle weighty matters of life and death, but if henceforth those of that caliber may thinkify a bit more, they, too, shall be great.

Thanks!

## [AMA: 20 Things I Wish I Knew Before Going to an Elite College](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gar45h/ama_20_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_going_to_an/)
Hey there! I graduated from a mid-ranked Ivy a few years ago. Below is a list of 20 things I wish I knew before going to an elite college. This advice applies to anyone attending an elite college or university (eg. Michigan, Colby, WashU, Georgetown, MIT, Claremont McKenna, Amherst, Brown, ect.) next year.

First, a little bit about myself. I had a decent college experience that was amazing in many ways and less good in others. After graduation, I moved to DC and worked in politics for a couple years. This fall, I applied to law school, and I‚Äôve been accepted to a number of good programs. I‚Äôm currently deciding among UChicago, Columbia, and NYU.

I'm also happy to answer questions as well, so feel free to ask away (after glancing through the questions I've already answered). Without further ado, here is the list!

1. It doesn‚Äôt matter which elite college or university you go to.

A lot of people agonize over the fact that they didn‚Äôt get into Harvard and have to settle for Cornell, or that they didn‚Äôt get into MIT and have to go to Carnegie Mellon. Honestly, the truth is that where you go to school doesn‚Äôt matter so long as you go to an elite college or university. Today, the great news is that there are so many elite colleges and universities that provide the same quality education and similar professional and graduate school opportunities (see list of colleges and universities above).

For example, if one person goes to Colgate, another person goes to Harvard, and both people major in economics and apply to PhD programs in economics after they graduate, they‚Äôll both have similar odds at getting into elite PhD programs assuming their GPAs, research experience, and faculty recommendations are similar. If the Colgate guy has better grades, better research experience, and better faculty recommendations, he‚Äôll get accepted to a better economics PhD program than the Harvard guy.

The same is true for other grad schools (eg. law, medicine, business, ect.) and jobs (eg. Facebook, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey). So long as you go to an elite college or university, you‚Äôll have largely the same opportunities as someone else who went to a slightly higher ranked elite college or university.

Additionally, people (who matter, such as employers and grad schools) largely view elite college grads from all elite schools as equally smart regardless of the elite school they attended. For example, when I meet someone from Princeton and someone from UVA, I‚Äôm not automatically more impressed with the Princeton guy, and I don‚Äôt automatically think the Princeton guy is smarter than the UVA guy. Instead, there‚Äôs more of an elite college/non-elite college dichotomy in my mind and in the minds of most elite college alumni and most employers. In other words, if I meet someone who went to WVU and someone who went to UVA, Princeton, Pomona, or Emory, I automatically DO think the non-elite college WVU guy is dumber than the elite college guy from any elite school (sorry, but it‚Äôs the truth!). However, I don‚Äôt really distinguish among the elite college guys based on the schools they attended. Instead, I distinguish them based on their intellect, personality, and professional success.

2. All of the students at one highly ranked elite school aren‚Äôt necessarily smarter than all of the students at another slightly lower ranked elite school.

Yup, this is definitely true. Just because your high school classmate‚Äôs going to Harvard and you‚Äôre going to Cornell doesn‚Äôt mean that one year from now, two years from now, three years from now, or four years from now your high school classmate will be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than you. During college everyone grows intellectually and some grow more than others regardless of which school they attend. This means that you could graduate from Cornell with a 3.8 GPA while your high school buddy at Harvard might not adapt too well to college and might only pull a 3.4. Guess who‚Äôs ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and has better professional and grad school opportunities when you graduate college? You, the Cornell guy! The same is true even if you attended Colby or UVA while your high school classmate went to Harvard.

3. Higher ranked elite colleges aren‚Äôt necessarily more difficult academically than lower ranked elite colleges.

Yup, this one‚Äôs also true. Just because Harvard‚Äôs acceptance rate is twice as low as Amherst‚Äôs acceptance rate doesn‚Äôt make Harvard students twice as smart as Amherst students or Harvard classes twice as hard as Amherst classes. Honestly, the students at both schools are likely equally smart and the classes are probably about the same in terms of academic rigor.

That being said, there are some schools that are known for grade deflation, such as Columbia, UChicago, and Princeton. These schools are likely more academically rigorous than places like Dartmouth or Harvard, but their academic rigor stems less from their ranking and selectivity and more from their administrative policies and academic traditions that reinforce grade deflation.

4. Even if you didn‚Äôt get admitted to an elite college or university, your life is not over.

Even if you didn‚Äôt do so well in high school grade-wise or got unlucky in college admissions, don‚Äôt panic. Your life is not over. You can still get into a top-notch grad school and/or get a top notch job and have phenomenal opportunities for the rest of your life.

I know many people who have done this. One of my professors at my Ivy league school who has a Wikipedia page (yup, he‚Äôs that famous in his field!) went to a bad California public college for undergrad and ended up getting a PhD from and a professorship at an Ivy League school. Similarly, one kid from my high school did really poorly academically in high school, got his s\*\*\* together at a tiny, no-name liberal arts college, and now attends Stanford Law School. Heck, I didn‚Äôt even get admitted to Stanford Law when I applied this fall while he did! It just comes to show that you can‚Äôt rest on your laurels if you do get into an Ivy League undergrad school, and you can‚Äôt be down on yourself if you don‚Äôt.

Suffice to say that if you‚Äôre dying to get that elite college or Ivy League degree, you‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to do so after undergrad. Most Ivies have great grad schools that you can attend later on in life. Or, to really spice things up, go abroad to Oxford, Cambridge, or LSE and get that one year British master degree immediately following college graduation! Tons of Americans do this.

5. If you have multiple acceptances from elite colleges, pick the elite college where you feel you would fit in best.

Deposit day is right around the corner for most schools, and if you‚Äôre still agonizing over which elite college to choose, here‚Äôs a simple pro tip: pick the elite college where you‚Äôll be happiest. For example, if you were admitted to Cornell and Georgetown and you believe that you would be happier at Georgetown compared to Cornell but are worried that ‚ÄúGeorgetown isn‚Äôt an Ivy!‚Äù, go to Georgetown. Both schools are close enough in prestige that it doesn‚Äôt really matter which one you choose. Because you believe you‚Äôll fit in better at Georgetown, you‚Äôll be happier there, make more friends there, and get better grades there, which will create more future opportunities for you than you would have gotten had you chased the Ivy League label and gone to Cornell instead.

I say this from personal experience. While I enjoyed my college in many ways and would still recommend it to many potential students, I believe that I would have been happier at Williams or Amherst, and I would have gotten the same exact opportunities at both schools that I got at my school.

That being said, if you are admitted to a non-elite school (eg. OSU, UF, Ole Miss, ect.) and an elite school, if finances/student loans aren‚Äôt an issue, definitely choose the elite school over the non-elite school. I have nothing against non-elite schools, but the truth is that you will not get the same opportunities at these schools that you will at elite colleges. For this reason, if finances aren‚Äôt an issue, always pick the elite school.

6. If you have multiple acceptances from elite colleges, pick the elite college that aligns best with your future goals.

If you‚Äôre still having trouble choosing which elite college to attend, consider which one will most align with your future goals. For example, if you were admitted to Dartmouth and Rice, and you are dead-set on living in Houston for the rest of your life, go to Rice. Why? Because a much larger proportion of your potential college friends from Rice will settle in Houston after college, and you‚Äôll have a much larger network of friends in your city, which will make life more enjoyable and help you advance in whichever career you choose.

If you want to live abroad, make sure you choose a school that has a stronger international brand reputation. For example, if you‚Äôre choosing between Williams and Georgetown, and you‚Äôre 100% sure that you want to live abroad for a significant portion of your life, you should probably choose Georgetown (unless you absolutely hate it) because far more people abroad will know Georgetown than Williams.

In general, a plurality of graduates from each elite school tend to cluster in one or two cities. For Dartmouth and all the New England Ivies/Little Ivies, it‚Äôs Boston and NYC (and SF to a lesser extent). For Penn, it‚Äôs Philly and NYC (and SF to a lesser extent). For Princeton and Columbia, it‚Äôs NYC (and SF to a lesser extent). For UVA and Georgetown, it‚Äôs DC (and NYC to a lesser extent). For Berkeley and Stanford, it‚Äôs SF and LA (and NYC to a lesser extent). For Northwestern, UChicago, Notre Dame, and WashU, it‚Äôs Chicago (and NYC to a lesser extent). For Duke and Emory, it‚Äôs Atlanta (and DC/NYC to a lesser extent).

Does this mean that there are no elite college alums from your elite college in non-feeder cities? No! Of course there are alums in these cities, and these cities will likely have alumni clubs that you can join. However, chances are that the majority of your future friends at whichever elite school you attend will likely follow the crowd to the feeder city(ies) that most alums from your school go to after graduation. Definitely keep this in mind as you choose which college to attend.

Internationally, most larger American elite schools (eg. non liberal arts colleges) will have solid alumni networks and alumni clubs in London and Hong Kong. Other cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Paris, Berlin, and Dubai may have alumni, but there might not be a large, active alumni club, so if you want to live in these locations, it‚Äôs definitely a good idea to choose a university with more name recognition internationally (eg. Berkeley over Amherst, unless you hate Berkeley) that will make you recognizable to people you may meet and befriend while living in one of these cities.

7. Attending an elite college or university for undergrad does NOT guarantee that you‚Äôll be admitted to an elite college or university for grad school.

Attending an elite school for undergrad does not give you a free pass in grad school admissions. Sure, it makes grad school admissions easier compared to the guy applying to grad school from University of Detroit or Frostburg State, but you still have to earn your spot in grad school, and you can‚Äôt just coast based on the prestige of your elite undergrad school.

For example, since all med schools are really selective (eg. <10% acceptance rate), most of my classmates from my Ivy in medical school attend places like Iowa, Rutgers, and Texas Tech. Did a couple get admitted to Harvard and Columbia? Sure, but only one or two. While these lesser ranked schools aren‚Äôt necessarily housed in prestigious universities, all of my classmates at these med schools are guaranteed to have stable, high-paying jobs for life, regardless of which one they attend. That is definitely an enviable position to be in, so they‚Äôre certainly doing very well for themselves.

For law school, graduating from an elite undergrad school definitely gives you a bit of a bump, but not a massive one. For example, if the median college GPA of admitted students at a law school that you‚Äôre applying to is a 3.9, then you‚Äôll be competitive with a 3.8 or a 3.85 instead of a 3.9 by virtue of the fact that you went to an elite school. Suffice to say that it‚Äôs a bit of a bump, but not a massive one. However, by attending an elite school, you‚Äôve likely gotten a lot of opportunities to polish the soft side of your application (eg. extracurriculars, recommendations, ect.) due to the sheer amount of resources available at elite schools. This soft part of your application will stand out more compared to applicants who didn‚Äôt attend elite schools. In general, I‚Äôd say more than three quarters of my classmates who applied to law school from my Ivy got accepted to T14 law schools. However, nearly one quarter didn‚Äôt, and several opted out of the application process altogether because they knew that they wouldn‚Äôt get into a T14 school.

Other grad programs elite college graduates regularly attend include business school, public policy/international affairs school, and PhDs. While attending elite colleges raises your chances slightly for admission to these elite grad schools, it does not guarantee that you‚Äôll be admitted to Harvard Business School, Princeton‚Äôs Woodrow Wilson School (public policy/international affairs), or Stanford‚Äôs PhD in Computer Science. Heck, attending an elite undergrad doesn‚Äôt 100% guarantee that you‚Äôll get admitted to UT Austin‚Äôs MBA program or University of Washington‚Äôs Computer Science masters program.

This means that you can‚Äôt rest on your laurels. You still have to work hard and earn your spot at an elite grad school.

8. If you‚Äôre burnt out from high school, take a gap year.

I really wish I had taken a gap year after high school. I went to a very competitive high school where lots of kids go to elite colleges and universities, and I was really burnt out when I showed up at college. While I did well academically my freshman year, I really believe that I would have benefitted from some time off.

For this reason, I‚Äôd highly recommend that you take a gap year if you‚Äôre burnt out. However, just because you‚Äôre taking a gap year doesn‚Äôt mean that you should be unproductive and do nothing. Instead, take some online courses, do a remote internship, or learn a foreign language. You won‚Äôt have many more opportunities in your life when you have several months without any commitments, so take advantage of that time to be with family and learn a new skill or hobby.

9. If you want to learn a new foreign language, start taking classes in that foreign language the moment you arrive at your elite college.

If you always had a burning desire to learn Russian, Mandarin, Italian, Japanese, or any other language for that matter, but your high school didn‚Äôt offer classes in that language, guess what? Your elite college likely does and now is by far the best and easiest time in your life to learn that language. You will never again in your life have four years when you can consistently and easily devote yourself to learning a new foreign language. If you start a new language during your first semester freshman year and take a course in that language every single semester during your entire time in college (including a semester abroad with language immersion), I guarantee that you‚Äôll reach at least intermediate proficiency in that foreign language by the time you graduate, even if that language is Russian or Mandarin.

10. Elite colleges and universities only provide you with a limited set of (really good) careers options.

Oh boy, this is definitely a piece of information I wish I knew before attending my school. This information might be a bit of a downer for some, but attending an elite college or university will not open doors to every single career you‚Äôve dreamed of. In general, elite universities feed people into five or six different careers through their career and grad school advising offices.

First, they‚Äôll provide you opportunities to work on Wall Street (or other financial centers, such as Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta, depending on where your school is located) in investment banking. Investment bankers, or IBankers for short, usually work for large banks that were bailed out during the Great Recession, such as JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs. IBankers help companies sell stock and bonds and revalue themselves after merging with other companies or selling off portions of their own company. That one sentence explanation is a vast oversimplification of IBanking, so keep that in mind. On a daily basis, IBankers create excel spreadsheets and powerpoint slides. They work crazy hours (eg. 60-70 hours per week, plus work on the weekends), but they also get paid a lot of money right out of college (eg. $100,000+ first year). If this appeals to you, check out Wall Street Oasis (WSO), which has by far the most resources and information for those who want to work on Wall Street. If this doesn‚Äôt sound appealing to you, there are a few other options to consider.

Elite universities also provide their students and graduates with jobs in management consulting. Management consultants work in teams of five to ten people and advise senior management (eg. CEOs, executive VPs, COOs, MDs, ect.)  at large companies on the strategy and operations of their companies. Each week, consultants fly out to their client from the city they (the consultants) live in (eg. NYC, Boston, San Francisco, ect.). Usually, the client is located in pretty uneventful places like Spartanburg, South Carolina, so don‚Äôt get your hopes up about jetting over to Dubai or Miami and sipping martinis for the week. That‚Äôs not going to happen. Like IBankers, management consultants are glorified excel and powerpoint monkeys. Their hours are better than IBankers, and they usually do not have much weekend work. In order to land a consulting gig at a top firm (eg. McKinsey, Bain, and BCG, which are the Harvard, Yale, and Princeton of consulting), you‚Äôll need to earn at least a 3.8 GPA or you‚Äôll need to major in a hard STEM subject and pull above a 3.5 GPA. Otherwise, they probably won‚Äôt interview you even though you go to Williams, Harvard, or some other elite school. Still, you could land a consulting offer with a lower GPA at a less prestigious firm or a boutique firm, and you‚Äôll have a pretty similar experience. In other words, your elite college will provide you opportunities in management consulting so long as your college GPA isn‚Äôt terrible. If you want to learn more about management consulting, check out Management Consulted and WSO‚Äôs forum on management consulting.

Elite schools also open up doors in the tech world. If you‚Äôre a whiz at computer science, you‚Äôll have a strong shot at landing a software engineering job at Google, Facebook, Amazon, or another large tech company, provided that you can pass the coding interview. If you aren‚Äôt good enough to pass the coding interview at these places, rest assured as there are still plenty of other software job opportunities to choose from at less well known companies and startups, so you‚Äôll graduate with a job making at least $70,000 and probably upwards of $100,000 if you play your cards right. Prestigious tech companies (eg. Apple) also have non-software jobs that your career services office at your elite school may enable you to recruit for. These positions are notoriously difficult to land because the barriers to entry are low (you don‚Äôt need technical skills), but you‚Äôll at least have a better shot than most people at them because you attend an elite school.

Elite schools also help you win fellowships, such as Fulbrights and Teach for America. Your elite school likely has a fellowship office or a person in your career services office devoted to fellowships who can advise you. This advisor is typically not available at less prestigious institutions.

Elite schools also funnel students into professional graduate schools, especially law school and medical school. I‚Äôm not going to discuss either of these options here because I‚Äôve already discussed both at length in another question above.

On the other hand, here is what elite schools do NOT provide career-wise. Elite schools do NOT provide special opportunities in politics on Capitol Hill or at the UN. They do NOT have a bunch of job postings in journalism at the NY Times or the Washington Post. They do NOT open tons of doors in entertainment and Hollywood. They do NOT offer tons of professional opportunities for musicians and artists. Sorry to burst your bubble, but attending Harvard or any other elite school isn‚Äôt going to get you a job at the UN, NY Times, Hollywood, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Career services won‚Äôt do jack for you if those are your career goals (except maybe help you land an unpaid internship). Instead, you‚Äôll have to hustle on your own and network a ton to land those opportunities. It‚Äôs better for you to receive this tough love now than later on, even if it‚Äôs a bit of a downer to hear this.

Instead, maybe you always dreamed of being an English or History professor? Sorry to break it to you, but even if you‚Äôre talented enough to be a humanities professor (which you probably are) and even if you get into Harvard for your humanities PhD, the job market is so bad for humanities professors that you probably won‚Äôt get a job as a professor no matter how hard you try. The job market is marginally better for aspiring hard science and social science professors, but it‚Äôs still tough. If you really want to be a professor, go get a PhD in business after undergrad. While you probably won‚Äôt land a professorship at Harvard, there are tons of business professorships available at other schools, and you‚Äôll almost certainly land one if you work hard. Again, sorry for the downer, but it‚Äôs better to be blunt and brutally honest than to lie to you and not tell you the truth.

11. Be social and join extracurriculars once you arrive at your elite college or university, but don‚Äôt overextend yourself.

If you were shy and just studied a lot in high school, make sure you break out of your shell and be social once you arrive by joining and participating in a couple (more than one, but not 50+) extracurriculars and clubs on a very regular basis. If you feel social anxiety because you‚Äôre in a brand new place where half the kids were valedictorians or salutatorians at their high schools, don‚Äôt sweat it because your classmates are all feeling the same anxiety you‚Äôre feeling. My best advice to you is fake it ‚Äòtil you make it. Make sure to stand up straight, look your fellow classmates in the eyes, and smile. If you do those three things, you‚Äôll be fine.

12. Be aware of social hierarchies on campus and within your extracurriculars and clubs, but don‚Äôt be a social climber who spends their entire college life climbing these social hierarchies to the exclusion of everything else.

Once you arrive on campus, make sure you acquaint yourself with social hierarchies on campus and within your extracurriculars and clubs. For example, which clubs tend to be more popular? Which clubs are less mainstream (and frowned upon)? Ask yourself how people will perceive you if you join one club or another. Do some clubs feed into other clubs (eg. all members of the football team join one specific fraternity)? Who are the most influential people in the clubs you joined? How about the least influential?

At the same time, don‚Äôt be a shallow social climber who only cares about social status. People who only social climb end up miserable because they don‚Äôt form genuine friendships based on shared interests and values. Plus, social climbers don‚Äôt realize that at the end of four years once everyone graduates, the social hierarchy that existed on campus no longer matters at all as an alumnus or alumna of your elite college. Literally no one cares what sports team or fraternity or sorority you were in after you graduate. It sounds so ‚Äúthird grade‚Äù to talk about those things as alumni.

Nevertheless, make sure that you do not find yourself at the bottom of the social hierarchy while you‚Äôre in school (except initially WITHIN your extracurricular clubs where you‚Äôll de facto have to start at the bottom as a new student and member in the club). You will definitely pay a big price socially while you‚Äôre in school if you‚Äôre at the bottom socially, and you will definitely be less happy. The good news is that it‚Äôs very easy to not be at the bottom. Just have your social antenna up, be socially aware, and don‚Äôt join unpopular clubs that have a strong social stigma on campus.

13. Be strategic about the classes you take and the professors you choose.

In order to earn a high GPA, make sure you choose your classes and professors carefully. Some classes and professors are notorious for their harsh grading while others are much easier, and you should do everything you can to avoid the harder classes and professors. If you want to figure out which classes and professors are difficult, just ask an upperclassman majoring in a particular subject which ones they would avoid in their specific major.

Also, I‚Äôd highly recommend asking upperclassmen which classes and professors are the best. During fall semester, make it a point to ask five different upperclassmen which classes/professors were their favorite. Keep a list of these classes and professors and consider taking them if they align with your interests or distribution requirements.

14. Take classes in your strongest subject areas during your first semester of freshman year.

Attending an elite college is a big bump up in terms of academic rigor compared to high school. If you take humanities and social science classes, you will have more reading than you‚Äôve ever had before in an academic environment, and if you take science and math classes, you will have harder problem sets and exams than you‚Äôve ever experienced in high school. As a first year student, you will likely be in class with some upperclassmen who have one, two, and three years of elite college academic experience under their belts. This means that they will likely be more skilled academically than the average freshman, and it will be harder, but certainly not impossible, for first year students like you to perform as well as they, especially in subject areas you know little about.

For this reason, I would highly recommend that you take classes in subject areas that you are really strong in during the first semester of your first year. If you were a US History buff in high school, then take an American history class. If you crushed it in AP French last year, then take French. If you‚Äôve read tons of American literature, then take an American literature class. If you love stats, take a stats class.

15. Don‚Äôt be a ‚Äúknow it all‚Äù or a ‚Äútry hard‚Äù in class.

Don‚Äôt be the ‚Äúknow it all‚Äù who always raises their hand to answer every question in class. Don‚Äôt be the ‚Äútry hard‚Äù who tries to demonstrate that they're smarter than everyone else. People who behave this way are off-putting and have toxic personal brands and bad reputations on all elite college campuses. Don‚Äôt be one of those guys.

On the other hand, do make an insightful comment (or two, or three, depending on the class) every class if you‚Äôre in a discussion-oriented class (then shut up). Do go to office hours and forge strong relationships with your professors. Do participate in study groups with other students. Do write good essays and perform well on midterms and final exams. Do your best academically and earn good grades.

16. Invest time in dating.

Your four years at an elite college will be by far the easiest time to date during your entire life. You will be surrounded by hundreds to thousands of other smart, horny kids who are away from home for the first time and are keen to try new things. If you‚Äôre showing up to college as a virgin, guess what? So is the majority of your class, so you‚Äôre in good company, and there‚Äôs nothing to be embarrassed about.

If you‚Äôre confused or unclear about how to date, here are a couple simple tips that may be helpful whether you‚Äôre a guy or a girl. If you fancy someone in one of your classes or clubs, make sure you build a little rapport with them by engaging in small talk a couple times so they know who you are (which you‚Äôve probably/hopefully done before/after class or during club activities). Remember to stand up straight, smile (not in a cheesy, contrived way), and look them in the eyes when you talk to them (and everyone else for that matter). Then, ask them casually to grab lunch (or coffee if students at your elite college grab coffee regularly) by saying something like, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs grab lunch some time!‚Äù Remember, in romance, especially if you‚Äôre a guy, never ‚Äúask‚Äù to do something; instead, suggest doing something by saying ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do that.‚Äù

If they say no, they‚Äôre probably not interested in you romantically even if they think you‚Äôre a good person, so don‚Äôt take it personally and instead move on to another person. Luckily, there are hundreds to thousands of other people that you can date at your elite school, so don‚Äôt worry. However, don‚Äôt ask out several people in one club or one class during the span of a week or two. You‚Äôll come across as creepy if you do this.

If they say yes to lunch or coffee, you‚Äôll probably exchange phone numbers with them and set up a time for lunch/coffee. You might even go to lunch together right then and there. After you grab lunch/coffee with them once or twice, study buddy with them if they‚Äôre in your class or collaborate together on a project for your club. Be somewhat subtle about your intentions at this point, but don‚Äôt be subtle for too long, which could put you in the friendzone.

Then, if things are going smoothly, and you sense that they‚Äôre also interested in you romantically (eg. they sit really closely to you, text you all the time about non-school related stuff, talk about sex/romance with you, hug you, and/or physically touch you in sexual or non-sexual places) study buddy or work together with them in a common area of your dorm once and/or invite them to a party. Then, if that goes well, invite them to work together in your room or bring them back to your room, and the two of you will probably end up making out and/or hooking up. Always make sure you have consent during this last step. From there, you can convert this encounter into a relationship and have a boyfriend or girlfriend if you would like.

Investing time in dating now while you‚Äôre at an elite college when it‚Äôs easy and accessible will make you more effective at dating later in life after college when you interact with many fewer people and dating is not as easy.

17. Elite colleges don‚Äôt teach you how to network, but learning how to network is incredibly important.

Networking is an incredibly important skill that you won‚Äôt learn in your classes at an elite college. In order to excel personally, professionally, and socially as a student and graduate of an elite college, it‚Äôs essential that you take the time to learn how to network efficiently and effectively.

If you‚Äôre unsure where to start, here are a few simple tips that will help you become an effective networker. First, before you contact anyone, make a list of a few (two to four, not 10+) professional fields that you would like to work in. These might be finance, law, medicine, politics, or tech to name a few. Then, make a list of everyone you and your family know who either (a) lives in the city or location where you want to work and has a solid professional career in any field or (b) works in the field(s) you want to work in but lives in any location.

Once you have this list, contact all of these people (usually by email), tell them that you‚Äôre looking for career advice and ask them if they‚Äôd be willing to speak with you over the phone to give you advice. These phone calls are informally known as ‚Äúinformational interviews.‚Äù In most cases, assuming they know your family and you well, they will say yes to the phone call. However, if they don‚Äôt respond, send them a polite follow up email a week after you sent your first email, and if they don‚Äôt respond again, then don‚Äôt sweat it, move on, and speak to your other contacts on the phone.

Along with reaching out to people your family and you already know, you can also send ‚Äúcold emails‚Äù to people you do not know who work in your desired fields. Before ‚Äúcold emailing‚Äù random people, you should first reach out to graduates of your high school, graduates of your elite college, graduates of your elite college‚Äôs grad schools, and graduates of other colleges who were in your fraternity or sorority at other schools. Your elite college will have an alumni database that you can access; talk to advisors at your school‚Äôs career services office about acquiring this access. LinkedIn is also another great resource for tracking down alumni. Once you‚Äôve exhausted these sources, you can ‚Äúcold email‚Äù or ‚Äúcold call‚Äù anyone in your desired field regardless of the school they attended. Since you may not have any connections to people you ‚Äúcold email‚Äù or ‚Äúcold call,‚Äù you may end up having a very low success rate in acquiring new contacts for your professional network using this method (eg. one out of ten ‚Äúcold calls‚Äù may result in an actual connection). Nevertheless, with sufficient volume, ‚Äúcold emailing‚Äù and ‚Äúcold calling‚Äù can be very effective techniques for networking and are well worth the investment under the right circumstances.

Once you‚Äôre on the phone for an informational interview, start by asking your contact about their career (or instead about working in city X if they work in a different career field than your desired field but live in the city that you're targeting). After they‚Äôve spoken for a bit about their career (or city), tell them that you‚Äôre interested in careers (and/or internships) in their field (or careers in field Y in their city) and ask them for advice. If they work in one of these fields, you may want to only say that you‚Äôre interested in careers in their field and avoid mentioning the other fields altogether, even if you‚Äôre also interested in those fields as well. Additionally, they will likely have lots of advice to give you. If they don‚Äôt work in one of your desired fields, they probably won‚Äôt have as much advice to give you.

Either way, ask them if they know anyone that works in your desired field(s) and your desired work location(s) and ask them if they would be willing to introduce you to these people. If they say yes (which they hopefully will), they‚Äôll put you in touch with one or more of their contacts (usually via email) in your desired field(s) and location(s). Set up phone calls with their contacts, talk to them on the phone, ask for more contacts (especially if they don‚Äôt offer you an internship or a job), and repeat this process until you land a position. Send thank you emails to each person after every phone call and connect with each person you speak with on the phone on LinkedIn.

After each semester or every few months, send an email update to all of your contacts detailing anything new, RELEVANT, and/or interesting in your academic, extracurricular, and professional life (eg. classes you took, clubs you recently joined, internships you landed, awards you won, trips you took, ect.). When you send this email update to your contacts, do NOT add all of your contacts to one email message and send out one email message to everyone. Instead, send separate email messages to each contact and copy and paste the same text into each separate email message. While you‚Äôre networking, you may realize that some (or many) contacts you‚Äôve made are not worth investing much time in, so you may choose to stop sending them email updates on a regular basis.

That‚Äôs networking in a nutshell. If you follow these steps starting freshman year, you‚Äôll be way ahead of the pack compared to your peers.

18. Get an internship during your freshman summer.

A surprisingly large number of students at elite colleges waste their freshman summers doing nothing because they don‚Äôt invest time in procuring a freshman summer internship. While finding a freshman summer internship can be difficult given that many large companies and organizations don‚Äôt typically hire freshmen for the summer, landing a freshman summer internship is certainly not impossible, especially since you attend an elite college, which will make hiring managers more likely to give you an offer.

Most freshman summer internships are unpaid. This means that you need to either (a) find an internship near your parents‚Äô or relatives‚Äô homes where you‚Äôll get free housing and meals or (b) procure funding from family or other sources to cover the cost of living while you do your freshman summer internship in another city, such as NYC, DC, or SF. Elite colleges usually give grants to students doing unpaid public service internships, so you may be able to apply for funding from your school. Ask your career services office about funding options available at your school.

If you can't acquire funding for a freshman summer internship and/or you would prefer to live with family and relatives during your freshman summer, then you‚Äôll probably have to network with alumni of your elite college that live in your local area, family friends, your high school teachers, and anyone else you know that lives in your local area to land a freshman summer internship. Use the networking strategies listed above, and you should be able to find something.

There are several local internship options near your home that are feasible to get for each career field. For politics, you can volunteer for a congressional campaign or work in the district office of your local Congressman. For law, you can reach out to local law firms and see if they‚Äôll let you do some legal work during the summer. For tech, you can work for startups in your local area or remotely. For finance, you can contact wealth managers in your area and ask if they‚Äôll let you intern during the summer. For medicine, you can contact doctor‚Äôs offices or hospitals and ask to shadow a doctor or nurse for a few weeks. Suffice to say there are lots of internship options for freshman summer, and it‚Äôs up to you to seize them.

19. Find mentors.

While you're at your elite college, make sure you forge relationships with mentors. These mentors can include upperclassmen, professors, and alumni. Mentors will be able to advise you on all aspects of your life and will enable you to maximize your academic, personal, social, and professional success. By using the networking tips described above, you will develop strong relationships with a set of mentors who will be pivotal for your success

20. Have fun!

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, have fun! College is an amazing time wherever you end up going, so make sure as a student that you periodically put the books away and go to a frat party, floor party, and/or other social event(s). Never again in your life will it be deemed ‚Äúokay‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to stay up into the wee hours of the morning drinking (or not drinking) and partying on a weekly basis. Take advantage of this time and have fun! Don‚Äôt get in trouble or break the law, but do make sure you do some memorable things so that you‚Äôll have stories to tell and reminisce about when you hang out with your college buddies after you graduate.

Wherever you go to school, you‚Äôre going to have an awesome time. I sincerely mean that. Best of luck next year and as they say in theater, break a leg!

He turned it into a profiting business/startup to add to his LinkedIn resume and fired the other creators and coders who were on the original team.

EDIT:
Some of you have been calling for Harvard to rescind his application (https://tinyurl.com/rescindalbert). While I don‚Äôt condone his actions (he definitely made a sh*t-ton of shameful mistakes and shady moves in regards to this whole situation), getting him rescinded is too far. At most, we should get him to publicly admit he‚Äôs in the wrong, give the other developers credit where it‚Äôs due, and issue an apology toward them. We should make sure media outlets and investors recognize completely that he wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt the only one behind the project.

I also want to echo what u/ilovewatermelons24 wrote in a comment: ‚ÄúImportant reminder that just because we disagree with him doesn't mean we have to attack and criticize him in a non-constructive way. Be kind.‚Äù

EDIT: NVM, disregard what I said in the last edit. It‚Äôs not even disagreeing at this point. It‚Äôs just a clearly manipulative someone in the wrong. Dalbert‚ÄîMr. Admeeted‚Äîyou done screwed up.

## [What do you guys think of my valedictorian speech?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g3p2uo/what_do_you_guys_think_of_my_valedictorian_speech/)
‚ÄúOur Generation‚Äù

Memes, Tik Tok, Vine. Disney Channel, SpongeBob. Snapchat, and Fortnite. As the first generation of the twenty-first century, these are just a few things we‚Äôve grown up enjoying. They‚Äôve come to define who we are as a generation. And with it has come that occasional critique about how we spend too much time on our phones or simply doing absolutely ridiculous things. Similarly, I‚Äôd like to imagine that if the founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin -- ever saw us laughing at memes, learning Tik Tok dances, or playing Fortnite; they‚Äôd be terrified to know that we will one day be in charge of the country they founded. And yet, we would look George Washington straight in the eye, and tell him ‚ÄúOK, Boomer.‚Äù

We stick to our guns, and more importantly, our values. And I think that‚Äôs very important as I look forward to what our lifetime has to offer. Our generation has found itself at a watershed moment in human history; in this century we will embark upon a multitude of endeavors which will have profound effects on ourselves and our posterity.

To name just a few of these: It will be our generation which opens up a new era of space exploration --putting the first women and men on Mars, and establishing a permanent moon base. It will be our generation which will fight, and save, the Earth from climate change; a crisis that threatens humanity with ocean acidification, rising sea levels, mass extinctions, and increasingly extreme natural disasters. It will be our generation which will invent incredible new forms of communication and entertainment which we couldn‚Äôt even imagine right now; and thus, our generation which will be posed with prodigiously decisive questions in regards to new technology -- what are the dangers of self-learning artificial intelligence? Is it ok for us to live in a world of mass surveillance? What do we do when machines begin putting large amounts of people out of work?

What I‚Äôm trying to say is this: It will soon be our time to write in the book of human history. And in it, we will be responsible for writing the last sentence in the chapter which documents the past half-millenium of humanity. Then we will turn the page, and write the first sentence in the chapter which will document the next thousand years.

Now, I realize that I‚Äôm speaking about lofty ideas that are foggy in the distant future. And tomorrow, we certainly won‚Äôt be curing cancer or going to space. And that‚Äôs fine; we hardly have any of the answers right now, and we still have a lot to learn. But as we live in the moment, exploring life, always remember to keep an eye on the future. For as JFK said -- time and the world do not stand still; change is the law of life; and those who look only to the past, or the present, are certain to miss the future.

And here is the key, as we look to our future: it might not be one of us who takes those first steps on Mars or deals the final blow to climate change. But our species is societal; and so long as we find the best way for ourselves to contribute to society, then we have done our part. And we can know that the achievements of the 21st century -- which future generations will look back upon with great admiration -- are our own.

So let‚Äôs embrace our generation, even if some of the greatest minds of history would doubt our potential. If we played Fortnite with Isaac Newton, or showed Thomas Jefferson a hilarious meme, or taught Abraham Lincoln a tik tok dance, they wouldn‚Äôt think that we could create a positive change in the world. And I am inclined to agree with them. Because I don‚Äôt think that we will change the world for the better. I know we will. Thank you.

## [why I'm choosing to go to my safety state school over a T20](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fr9y0o/why_im_choosing_to_go_to_my_safety_state_school/)
This is not clickbait, I promise.

I don't post on here (or reddit) much, but I'm an avid lurker. And like most of you on this sub, I've grinded hard all of high school in hopes of getting into a good college. I have a ton of extracurriculars and awards, mostly to do with theater, on both a state and national level, leadership positions in multiple clubs, 8 APs, 1500+ SAT, a lot of work experience (3 different jobs over the past 2 years, with some overlap), hundreds of volunteer hours, etc.

So, after hearing back from everywhere, I ended up getting into one of my top schools. No one from my hs has gotten in there before, so I was shocked when I got into that T20. Yay! However, after weighing the pros and cons of going there, I've decided to commit with my safety school, and here's why:

1. Cost

I'm in that upper middle class income bracket where while my family is getting by comfortably and can help me pay for college, by no means can they  pay for all of it (nor would I want them to). My top school gave me no merit, and I won't be eligible for much financial aid (if any), so I'd have have to come up with 75k/year to pay for it. While my family would be able to help with some of it, I'd still have to front >$200k+ in loans. My safety school, on the other hand, gave me a full tuition scholarship, so all I have to pay is room & board, so **my entire college education there would cost less than 1 year at my top school.**

2. Fit

**You can't just pick what school you're going to based off of solely rankings.** If you do that, chances are you won't have a good time  (source: many people I know). The T20 has a great program for what I want to do, however, they're not nearly as flexible as the school I'm committed to. I wouldn't be able to do multiple study abroad semesters, and they might not even let me double major because they don't accept a lot of my AP credits. Also, I just don't vibe as much with the people going there. I'm in the honors college of the school I've committed to and the people there seem much more friendly and genuinely authentic than those I've talked to from the T20. This is just my personal experience though, but I know I want to feel like the people around me are real ones and I don't have to weed out as many superficial people that don't care about the people around them

3. Worth

In the field I'm studying, where you go to study for undergrad is not as important as what you do while you're there, and it's just not worth the extra debt. To get the most bang for my buck, I want to save as much money as possible for grad school in case I want to go down that route. **Just because you go to a good undergrad doesn't automatically set you up for complete success in life, it's all about what you make of it.**

In no way am I trying to knock T20s (because they're amazing schools for the most part and if you're going to one, congrats!!), I'm just saying that they're not the best or most feasible choice for everyone, and that it's good to keep an open mind when picking out where you want to spend your next few years and pick the school that's the best fit for you. I'm happy with the choice I've made and am hype to continue the grind the next 4 years! Also, this will probably be my last post on this sub, and I hope that everyone continues (or starts) to THRIVE! If anyone wants any more specific details about how I went about anything, feel free to PM me! Thanks to everyone on this sub for making this community a hilariously informative place.

&#x200B;

EDIT: thank you all for the overwhelmingly positive responses! many people have asked so i shall tell- the schools are USC (if that's technically not T20 and just T25 i'm sorry my b but like ok whatever same point) and Temple (go owls!!). And if you have any other random questions, feel free to PM me because I'm in a very unusual situation as a poli sci/theatre double major!

At least other asian parents let their children decide between doctor lawyer and engineer. My parents tell me the only options are computer science, computer science with a masters in computer science, or computer science with a masters and pHD in the field of computer science.

## [Stepping down](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f8gtik/stepping_down/)
When I became a mod of /r/ApplyingToCollege on August 1, 2016, there were 6,220 subscribers and it looked like [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801210734/https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege).

Within 2 weeks, I transitioned the sub to the [burnt orange colors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160815205121/https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege) some of you may remember. I kinda miss it: who knows, maybe someday we'll go back to that.

By January of 2017, we looked into the future and set the mission statement for A2C that we still stand by to this day: that is, to be the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to SAT/ACT test prep, career guidance, and more. Since then, we've come a long way and I think we've more than delivered on that vision: by some estimates, A2C has been getting more pageviews per day than CC.

After nearly 4 years, it's time for me to step back and focus on my life goals. To that end, I need to reduce my internet consumption and for me that means quitting reddit.

Your new top moderator will be the wonderful /u/admissionsmom: it goes without saying that the sub is in great hands. The rest of the mod team is doing an amazing job and they have my full confidence. We've had some great retired mods over the years as well: shoutout especially to /u/ivsamhth5, /u/ask_admissions, /u/GammaHuman, and /u/BlueLightSpcl.

As for advice, I'll say that you are the only thing standing between you and your dreams. No matter how difficult it may seem, no matter what everyone else is doing, no matter what obstacles you face, you always have the power to make your own destiny. Remember this and you will go far.

Best of luck to all of you, and thanks for the memories: I hope you all get into the college of your dreams. Without further ado, here are some of my favorite posts from over the years:

## [if y'all don't wanna start college online, PLEASE do your part to stop the spread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fnmjvk/if_yall_dont_wanna_start_college_online_please_do/)
even if the pandemic is still going on by the fall (very possible, according to the harvard institute of public health), we may still be able to go to college in person if America does it like South Korea (testing available without symptoms, local tracking of confirmed cases, people not being selfish about medical supplies, and government-supplemented income).

all of this requires us following directions to socially distance for now while pressuring the CDC to import more tests and the FDA to approve them (while the CDC has shown that they suck at making test kits, Germany and South Korea are doing great with them). don't be stupid, please.

It just SUCKS because I‚Äôm so fricking privileged to live in a place with soooo many opportunities to take advantage of and I can‚Äôt! Stupid green card gives me noooo street cred without being a citizen.

I know I‚Äôm not competitive enough to actually get a DC internship or to intern with NASA but I‚Äôd like the opportunity to at least *try*. I never realized how disadvantaged being interested in political science/public policy is without being a citizen. I feel like I‚Äôm just realizing this major isn‚Äôt going to be sustainable for me to pursue in college if I can‚Äôt actually get DC political experiences as I probably won‚Äôt get my citizenship in time.

## [An analysis of 3,069 college emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gcswb4/an_analysis_of_3069_college_emails/)
I once read a post on /r/A2C nearly one year ago from /u/Popopopper123 titled "A brief analysis of 2374 college emails" which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aibmii/a_brief_analysis_of_2374_college_emails/), and I knew when reading that I would want to conduct some analysis of my own.

One year later, I finally committed to a university, ~~I'm procrastinating studying for my AP exams~~, and I'm excited to take a look at the schools that have been harassing me for the past 4 years.

**Disclaimers:**

* These numbers may actually be underestimated. In the fall, I created a new email address that I thought was more professional than my last. I set up my old inbox to forward every email I received to the new email inbox, but there possibly were emails that got caught in the spam filter of my first email that I could not get access to.
* I'm not sure of the legality of this, but my high school gives assignments that are basically filling out forms with your information, and this information is then sold to colleges. I was forced to give out my information probably 5 times.
* I took the PSAT 3 times, SAT 3 times, and ACT 2 times, and never once did I opt out of the Student Search Service.
* I don't believe I deleted any emails, and I usually added them to a folder that was specifically for college mail. I don't believe I unsubscribed either, but I may have gotten annoyed once or twice and done it a couple times.
* I only ever personally requested information from two colleges: the University of Florida and the University of Pennsylvania.
* I made sure not to include any emails of the 14 colleges I applied to after I submitted my application so as not to skew their numbers.
* I counted these numbers by searching each college's name and recording them in an excel sheet, and I am prone to error.

----------------------------

# General Statistics:

* I counted a total **3,069 emails** from **127 different colleges**.
* The average college sent me **\~24** emails each. (median: 15 for you AP statistics folks)

# T20 Schools:

* Colgate University once addressed an email to me as "Dear {\[PREFERRED\]}". Someone in the recruiting office made an oopsie.
* Only **355** emails said that they had received my information from CollegeBoard's Student Search Service.
* **363** (!) emails had a "P.S." at the bottom.
* Mount Aloysius College once sent me **11** emails within the span of 24 hours.

---------------------------------------------

One thing that I think would be very cool would be to make a cumulative bar chart over time like the ones currently popular over on /r/dataisbeautiful but that would require some coding and is way out of my expertise.

Uh I think that's it. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Let me know if you are curious about something else in the comments and I can try my best to give an answer.

## [Poor kids have it worse. In response to middle class complaints on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cqkgri/poor_kids_have_it_worse_in_response_to_middle/)
It's a pretty common notion here that middle class kids get fucked over the worst with financial aid - because rich kids can afford to pay in full, and poor kids qualify for lots of aid. And I'm not going to refute that middle class people do get fucked over quite often. Middle class kids often don't qualify for the aid that they would benefit from, and that's not a good thing.

The notion that middle class kids have it *worse* than poor kids is incredibly insensitive and wrong, though.

Someone made a comment on one of the recent front page "the middle class gets the shortest end of the stick :(" posts with something to the effect of "the poor will always have it worse" and I want to echo that sentiment and make sure some of y'all get a little clarity on what being poor is actually like.

So sure, poor kids get a lot of financial aid. Might get all of their tuition, all of their room and board paid for. That doesn't account for all the other expenses, though. That doesn't account for food, for all of the living supplies like toiletries, cleaning supplies, new sheets because nobody owns a Twin XL at home. And while everyone has these expenses, they're a lot bigger of a burden on poor people, and y'all better not have the audacity to try and refute that. Simply living on a day to day basis can be a challenging expense for some folks.

I'll use the disclaimer that I'm poor, so yeah, I'm going to be more sensitive to my fellow poor kids. I got over 3/4 of my tuition and housing paid for with need-based aid. But that's only the beginning of the expenses. I feel guilty buying the things that I need to live in college. Even buying things from the thrift store and the dollar store - I still feel horrible for the burden it is on my parents. Because that's what it's like. Buying sheets is a burden. Buying a hamper for my laundry. Paying for laundry. Paying for books. We already skimp on breakfast sometimes if we haven't gotten paid yet and don't have the spare fucking 2 dollars for a dozen eggs. I'm worried for how they'll fare this year after I've left, with monthly tuition bills on top of every other expense.

Being poor isn't some great circumstance that middle class kids should somehow envy. It fucking sucks. And while I understand that it's frustrating not to receive financial aid, I promise you that you are NOT getting the shortest end of the stick. It's really disheartening and disgusting to see people on here acting like being middle class is the worst thing that happened to them, and that somehow, they've got it worse off than poor people. **Being poor isn't worth all the financial aid in the world.**

Sorry if this comes off as mean, but I'm at my wits' end and I'm absolutely disgusted with the misunderstanding of poorness on this sub. Not everybody here acts like it, but I have seen far too many posts here complaining about how middle class kids have it the worst for college, and far too many of them are making it to the front page. I understand your frustration. But not one of you would want to live a day in a poor kid's shoes. It's insensitive to erase those struggles and act as though your lack of financial aid is a bigger problem than things like, I don't know, poverty.

Inb4 "struggle is not a competition" I know it isn't. But there are people on this sub acting like it is and that they've got it the worst, when there are so many other struggles in this community.

## [How much will a generic first name hurt my chances of getting accepted to Harvard???](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c34ng2/how_much_will_a_generic_first_name_hurt_my/)
This might sound odd, but please hear me out.

My first name, Jacob, was ranked the most frequently-given baby name of 2001 (ssa.gov). Since I know that elite colleges look at applications "holistically" and want a diverse class, will having an extremely common first name like 'Michael' or 'Matthew' drastically lower my chances of being accepted? There was a person at my school two years ago (who I think was originally called James)... he switched his name right before application season to 'Tichawonka' and got into Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, Tsinghua, etc. Coincidence? I doubt it; he flunked nearly all his classes and had virtually no ECs.

My mother and the 11 out of 12 of my private college consultants believe that I should replicate this in compensation for donating only one building to Harvard this year. I really don't want this to happen (I prefer my current name to some of the alternatives my parents have suggested). To make matters worse, we've already hired a big-name lawyer who "can get it done within a week". I'm very skeptical... is it really a good idea to legally change your first name in order to boost your chances at these top institutions?

Stats: 1500+ SAT, \~5.9 GPA, average ECs (internships at multiple Fortune 500 companies, founded the school swimming team, 2018 Spelling Bee semifinalist, NSHSS chapter president)

## [With RD season coming up: When you decline admission or withdraw your app to a college, they‚Äôll ask you for a reason, and you should say it was for financial reasons.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fbjckd/with_rd_season_coming_up_when_you_decline/)
Colleges use the questionnaire as data to help them know who‚Äôs accepting, who‚Äôs declining, and it‚Äôs not a stretch to think it‚Äôll be used to benefit the school especially in increasing their yield in the future.

So if you put down that you‚Äôre going to another school and put the reason as they have a better program or something else, they‚Äôll make a note of your stats and may use it to make a more informed decision in whether to accept or decline a similar student in the future. You‚Äôll be required to give a reason in the questionnaire too, and sometimes they require you to put down the school you‚Äôve accepted instead too so you can‚Äôt leave it blank.

In order not to let your data be used in this way and to put pressure on colleges to give more aid or decrease tuition, put down financial aid as the main reason. There are no downsides to this. You won‚Äôt screw future classes over, and if enough people do it, it‚Äôll make a statement. College is too fucking expensive.

EDIT: Not condoning lying, but if you‚Äôre choosing another school for multiple reasons with financial aid being one of them, put financial aid down as the reason since they‚Äôre usually only asking for one.

EDIT 2: Hey everyone, wow I wasn‚Äôt expecting this post to blow up like this. I‚Äôve wrote a few loooong comments as replies to people who think colleges using data like this is a ludicrous idea, but I figured a lot of people won‚Äôt see them, so putting some info here. More links in the comments.

How are colleges using your data? Well, already pretty unethically. At the University of Wisconsin-Stout and over 43 other colleges (at least the ones The Washington Post found), [they](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) collect your data and use it in such a way without feeling the need to tell you because to quote Buff State: ‚ÄúYou have a choice of not interacting at all‚Äù referring to the fact that people make a choice to visit the website and they can get their info through phone calls or social media posts instead. Ludicrous, right? They‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre agreeing to colleges using your data to score you when you‚Äôre looking up information and need to make a choice between a detailed database with answers to most of your questions and an Instagram post. I think you need to access the website to find the phone number too.

At UW-Stout, they use an algorithm to assign you a score out of 100 to determine what‚Äôs the likelihood you‚Äôd accept an offer if given and use it to make decisions. It‚Äôs also not said (hmm) where they got the data for the algorithm. I‚Äôm a CS/Philosophy major, so the role of trust in an online relationship is super interesting, but to me, I think these events have diminished, perhaps obliterated, any trust in the relationship between you and colleges. Perhaps better advice would have been to not answer the questionnaires at all and forgo making a statement. Your data is valuable, so protect it. This is another way colleges obscure the admissions process to increase the power imbalance in their favor, and transparency and organizing as a collective is how we get the power back.

## [College admissions is a lot like dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/easb2y/college_admissions_is_a_lot_like_dating/)
I see a lot of people on here get really surprised when a seemingly perfect candidate gets rejected. Even with a 1600 SAT, 36 ACT, 4.0, started a non-profit, internships, research publications, summer programs, the blessing of the Pope himself... they get the same thicc rejecc that 90% of applicants to competitive colleges will recieve.

"How could *they* be rejected?"

**"If** ***they*** **can't get in, then who can??"**

I realized though, this whole admissions thing is a lot like romantic relationships. Even if someone is perfect on paper, if there's no chemistry or they're not the right person for you, the relationship isn't gonna work out.

Even if someone is the 'perfect applicant', they still may not be the right student for a certain college. It goes the other way too: just because a school is prestigious doesn't mean it's where you're gonna be the happiest.

Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but sometimes reading posts on this subreddit can be quite stress inducing. Here are some self care tips to help you get through this time. I would say something about how college isn‚Äôt the endgame, but I know yall super-motivated types won‚Äôt listen :) so here are some simple tips instead that I hope you will follow in the next few months:

1. Drink lots of water. Coffee and energy drinks do not count as water. Alcohol counts as negative water.

2. Eat right. Eat your damn greens and stay off processed food if you can. Stress can make your immune system much more fragile and a bad diet will make you lethargic and affect your focus.

3. Sleep. Please please please get enough sleep. Again, just sleeping more will make you more alert and think more clearly, which will help you this year. Essays that you write at 4am while running on 3 hours sleep will be awful anyway. Get your rest.

4. Be a little social. Maybe this won‚Äôt apply to a lot of you but for me, I tend to shrink into myself when I need to get focused, and spending too much time in your own head isn‚Äôt going to do your academics any favours. Really. It‚Äôs like saying a word over and over until it no longer seems to make sense, except in your own head. If you‚Äôre an introvert like me that gets even more introverted during times of stress, I recommend you do at least one activity a week that can let you take your mind completely off college prep for a few hours. Like sleep, this will do wonders for your mental state.

Believe in yourselves guys. I wish you all the best. Keep positive, and don‚Äôt let negative thoughts spiral. You are all smart and capable people, and you don‚Äôt need to destroy yourself physically and mentally just for some school. Your biggest asset is who you are, and not your potential degree in whatever. Take care of it.

## [Will my special situation excuse a 2.0 GPA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c0ir03/will_my_special_situation_excuse_a_20_gpa/)
I am an international applicant planning to apply for ED (Don't need aid) at Northwestern University. Planned Major: Journalism

My GPA was 2.2 and 2.0 in the first two years of HS and is now 4.0 (In my new school were I don‚Äôt get blackmailed)

I would like to write an essay about how I uncovered a case of sexual harassment and blackmail at my school. Several people were therefore convicted in court. I hope this can explain my low GPA (and impress NU). Will that work?

Story:
I was the first two high school years at a elite school with a excellent reputation. A super popular teacher was there regularly sexually harassing girls and then blackmailing them very badly. I happened to notice this and collected evidence for months until I had enough in my hands against him. The school management wanted to cover the incidents, then blackmailed me and gave me the worst marks ever for 1.5 years and threatened me with made-up gossip about me. I then turned to the media with my evidence and caused a huge scandal. The school was shut down and several people went to prison. The whole thing was a huge story in my country. I also received a relatively important journalism prize for it. (Not meant as flex)

Of course I changed schools and am a pretty good student at my new school (4.0). My Councelor knows about the story and would also explain my low GPA in the first two high school years in his LOR. But will that be enough? Will the AO takes my special situation into account?

TIA!!!

This is the single most pertinent piece of advice I have to share. I was a pretty darn strong applicant in the '23 application season, but I got denied from every T20 engineering school I applied to (and a couple more). Why?

Because I thought physics wasn't necessary for CS majors. And it isn't. But it *is* necessary for admission to engineering schools- or, at least, the more selective ones. And most of the time, CS is in engineering schools rather than Arts & Sciences.

So, don't make the same mistake I did, CS majors shooting for prestige. Don't take APES because you know AP Physics is hard and decide to take a little break during senior year (which is what I did). **Take physics**.

Hi, I work in an admissions office and it's come to our attention that y'all got a previous "pro tip" to just copy/paste a template to get some super cool and dandy T-shirts from a ton of universities.

On behalf of all admissions offices across the nation, please stop.

It's been months now and we're still getting in hundreds of emails. Our inboxes are flooded with the same "weird question" mass emails saying that you as a student has "always been interested in your university," and it would be "an absolute dream to attend," but then forget to blind copy in the other 150+ colleges you're also sending this email to. It's becoming difficult to sift through the tons of repetitive letters to find students with honest questions.

We're working at a desk constantly answering phone calls, processing mail, doing office tasks, fielding in-person questions, and answering the already high amount of emails we get on the daily. We don't have time (or resources) to go through each and every person and give them t-shirts, so you know what we do? We delete them. We've deleted countless amounts of these things. We no longer send fun materials or pens or pennants because you guys abused the system and now it's no longer available to everyone.

Leave our inbox alone for real questions and just buy an old college t-shirt from Goodwill, please.

# Part 1: Y u no like?

An older acquaintance of mine (not one of the likely beneficiaries of a then-controversial social topic) once told me that such a program, when done properly, would be a program "with excellent long term benefits for society while being horribly unfair for me, personally." For this reason, he supported it, even while fully understanding that it would negatively impact his own chances for success in the future.

He got into UC Berkeley. He's fine.

Looking back on my days in high school, it seemed that just about everyone had the exactly opposite opinion: *F\*ck society, do what's best for my chances to get into university.* For this reason, many of them ended up starting volunteer organisations.

"But u/4_8_15_16_23_and_42!" You cry. "How can starting a volunteer organisation be bad for anyone?" To answer that question, let's look at a theoretical best-case scenario. Suppose you (hypothetical college-hungry junior/senior) decide to start a volunteering organisation. It all goes well, you use buzzwords like "underserved/marginalised community", "technological integration", "outreach" etc. You even get a few TED talks/grants/news stories out of it. You demonstrate your app to a starry-eyed interviewer complete with a tale of woe about how many trials and tribulations you had to overcome to succeed, which earns you, say, a heartfelt handwritten note of congratulations and a shiny ticket to INSERT\_IVY\_LEAGUE\_SCHOOL\_HERE. Then, feeling a profound sense of pride and accomplishment, you forget all about it and settle for a lucrative job in the finance industry.

Leaving aside any ethical implications about pretending to be interested in things you would otherwise ignore if not for university, (Morals? In *this* economy?) and the opportunities you take away from people with less resources but more genuine enthusiasm about helping people (more on that later), what have you actually done?

We know that creating a long term impact in marginalised communities (*especially* when working with children in fields like education) requires consistent and targeted intervention over more than, say, one summer or even one year- Developing a working relationship and measuring the impact any volunteering has on children and other vulnerable groups, not to mention identifying the help they need in the first place, is a time-intensive and difficult effort poorly suited for highly stressed multitasking high school seniors. Adding to the problem, the nature of student-led societies means that they generally come with expiration dates of less than two or three years, with most being abandoned after that long-sought-after "Congratulations!" letter, and any hope of sustained outreach virtually disappearing after that vaunted plane ride to a dream school far far away.

What you leave behind, of course, are the "underprivileged groups" and burning needs you so artfully identified in your essays, whose lives may have been briefly improved by your tactical involvement but are now left essentially to drift after being used and abandoned in your quest for a few more lines on that extracurriculars section of CommonApp.

# Part 2: It gets worse

Okay, you might say, maybe my organisation didn't quite achieve the long-lasting global impact I hinted at in my "How I contributed to my community" essay. Still, a starfish saved is a starfish saved, right? To answer that question, let's take a closer look at what exactly "success" entails.

In many cases, especially when the Ivies are involved, "success" for an student non-profit requires not only that they start the organisation, but attract attention both in terms of funding and media coverage, becoming featured on local or even international news while receiving grants and nominations from international foundations, maybe with a TED talk or two thrown in. While this may at first seem positive ("look how much I'm helping!"), what many people don't realise is that there are already existing organisations run by committed and passionate adults in your field that any student organisation now competes with in terms of funding, volunteers, and attention- even though one of you comes with a self-destruct and an escape pod attached.

When you run the community service equivalent of a pump and dump scheme, not only do the resources and coverage you receive essentially become wasted investments, the organisations that would have received long term benefits from those resources lose the opportunity to utilise them to their greatest potential, all in the service of "student-led innovation". In many cases, the problems and issues you overcame have already been overcome by others with more experience and persistence, all while resources that could have gone to improving lives are wasted. Yes, it is great experience and college AOs eat it up. No, you shouldn't toy with lives for that experience. Go run an MUN conference or something.

At this point, you might think that I'm being overly harsh to these student non-profits. After all, how do you expect teenagers to cope with the subtle social dynamics and long term implications of managing a non-profit? To that, I would say: yes, I am being incredibly harsh. *That's what you need to run an ethical non-profit organisation.* It's the reason why so many real world volunteer organisations are [mired in scandal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2010/03/18/when-feeding-the-hungry-is-political), or [fail utterly](https://periscope.net.nz/failing%20charities). If it seems impossible for a high school student to run a long term, morally justifiable non-profit organisation, then you've just understood the best reason why they shouldn't try, *both for the benefit of those they want to help and for themselves*. High school, especially at the competitive level, is an [incredibly stressful experience](https://medium.com/@owenshen/the-ancient-god-who-rules-high-school-e0645b100ae6). To add to that burden the equivalent of multiple full time jobs most adults find challenging is an experience I would not wish on anybody.

I realise that this isn't a particularly optimistic or feel-good post. The truth is, most social problems can't be solved (or even meaningfully addressed) by a sixteen year-old with a can-do attitude and an above average work ethic. That's why they're still problems today. Furthermore, the entire concept of "doing something for college" is simply fundamentally flawed. The filmmaker Austin McConnell has an excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivfspJOAtBI) where he discusses the failure of his first film, Sprouting Orchids. At the end of the video, he says, "I guess that's [the film's] biggest flaw. I didn't create Sprouting Orchids to teach or entertain, I created it so I would feel worthy enough to call myself a filmmaker. I didn't make the movie because there was a story I was burning to tell, *I wanted to make a movie to say I had made a movie.* **That's vanity, not art.**"

**If you start a nonprofit to say that you started a nonprofit, that's vanity, not volunteering.**

# Part 3: What do?

After reading so far, you may feel mildly distressed, if you're an ethically minded high school student, or mildly annoyed, if you're slightly less ethically inclined. What do you do, say, if you actually want to make an impact, while staying ethical? And the truth is: I don't know. I don't want this post to discourage people from addressing problems that they see in their community, and especially not from innovating and being creative to solve those problems. I only ask that you take a look at what's already available, and consider the impacts of your actions. If you can be ethical and responsible and create an award-winning non-profit at age fifteen, all the more kudos to you. But sometimes, I would argue a lot of the times, when you consider starting a non-profit, there are already worthy organisations out there addressing the same issues, groups that you can help without creating the issues mentioned above. Sometimes, we have to support something that's great for society even if it feels unfair to us.

I realise how awful it feels, not to be able to say "I founded XXX" when everyone wears their accolades like medals. It can feel like you're being cheated, that you're putting in just as or more work without getting the same recognition from classmates or AOs. Everyone wants to be the trailblazer who discovers a new theory, or makes the next big app, or starts the next billion-dollar company. Nobody wants to be the guy that fixes the bugs, that quietly researches already known medicines, or offers small improvements to the existing system, even if they arguably help a lot more people than the "big names". But I can tell you something: I was that guy. I listened to my senior, and gave my time to organisations I found to be worthy, volunteered in places that already existed. When it came time to submit my applications, I was pretty honest, all things considered, and maybe you'll think I'm a sucker for doing that.

I got into UC Berkeley. I'm fine.

## [Don't Fantasize](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cbp698/dont_fantasize/)
Hello everyone. I'm a senior who graduated two months ago and would like to warn all you upcoming seniors about your college application process. The past year has been rough for me and the college application experience was fucking brutal. Hear me out for a second. I am a computer science major who applied to 10 schools and they were hard to get into for CS. I am an Illinois in the Chicago area resident and I applied to schools such as UMich, UIUC, Berkeley, UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, and the likes. I ended up getting rejected by all except two of my safeties (UIC and Loyola) after being waitlisted and given blue balls by Berkeley. When I was rejected by my schools I was devastated as I felt like my hard work was a waste of time. I decided to commit to UIC and I wasn't happy.

&#x200B;

Here's the point: Please do not believe that hard work alone will get you where you want to be at.  I remember grinding the SAT practice tests while watching videos about student life at my schools. I went through a lot of anxiety and worrying my senior year believing that maybe, JUST MAYBE, all my hard work and challenges would put me in a school where I would enjoy myself. I imagined myself on campus, where I would spend my time at making friends at my schools, and what activities I would be a part of. DO NOT DO THIS. It's like the saying "don't celebrate too early". Until you get accepted that's when you can start fantasizing. As much as we like to imagine that the world is just and that in the end we get everything we deserve, it is not like that. We like to imagine fairy-tale scenarios. The sooner you realize that you cannot control this shit is when you finally understand how to be happy. Please do not say "I'm for sure getting into this school" because when you don't, it is devastating. Life doesn't give a fuck about what you had to go through, you just gotta accept what it throws at you and make the best of it. I remember spending hundreds of hours reading about past students' stats and calculating my chances of getting in. I used to say stuff like "I'll be the lucky one who defines the odds". It was all a huge waste of time.

&#x200B;

After cooling off for the past couple of months, I'm not even mad about going to UIC. In fact, it may have been a huge lesson being rejected from all these schools as it taught me that hard work doesn't equal a good future. Luck is a big part in all of this too. So make smart investments and don't put too much effort / emotional investment into something that is not certain. The whole process is like gambling, it gives you a rush and if you lose it can hurt you. Good luck, upcoming seniors and please, be realistic. Don't fantasize about a perfect future but rather make the most of the present moment. If anyone has questions, don't be afraid to ask.

## [People need to stop saying recruited athletes took their spot in college](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dybazd/people_need_to_stop_saying_recruited_athletes/)
These kids worked their butts off to become top tier athletes so that they could earn a spot on a D1 or top tier university's team. And these schools have elite athletic programs with large followings of fans, so they have to make room in their class for these athletes or they wouldn't have a competitive team. They earned their spot in these colleges, albeit a different way than most, (sometimes harder if they still have really good gpa / sat score) and its just a shitty thing to say to them that they took someone else's spot.

Edit: (parantheses)
Also, my argument is not for or against atheletics in universities, it's something that's already there and plays a big role in universities

## [How to Respond if you Randomly Meet an Admissions Officer in Public](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dz4bw3/how_to_respond_if_you_randomly_meet_an_admissions/)
You're sitting on the bus. You have your Air-pods in so everyone knows you're a typical teenager. You're minding your own business and then all of a sudden an old guy gets on the bus and sits next to you. You remember that the guy always sits near the young people on the bus so you feel a little uncomfortable. He then starts to try to have small talk with you. He asks for your opinion about the big sports game last night and you reply "Joseph Mahma kicked the tennis racket right into the field goal post. It was exciting." because you want him to stop talking to you. He doesn't take the bait. He then tries to talk about the weather; he asks "How was the weather in your area last night?". You reply "Yes". Then he asks the dreaded question that you've feared for all of your high school life: "Where do you plan on applying to college?". You're tempted to "ok boomer" him but you're proud of your high school stats and activities and are a typical r/A2C overachiever so you tell him the list: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, St. Anford, and MIT, and ignore all the other Ivies because they are your safeties. Then he raises an eyebrow and asks what school you applied early to. You respond "MIT". You then notice a sly grin appearing on his face. He replies "Really? I'm an admissions officer at MIT." You start panicking and try to be polite. You start thinking of smart questions to ask him about MIT so he will remember you and want to admit you. You can't think of any good questions so instead you exchange names and emails so you can contact him later. You continue having small talk with him but now you're actually answering properly because you want him to have a good first impression of you. You have a pleasant conversation until he reaches his destination and has to get off the bus. As he's leaving he tells you "By the way I'm not actually an admissions officer at MIT or any college as a matter of fact. Thanks for the name and email" You are understandably shocked and confused and you ask him why he lied to you. He says "It's just a prank bro" and points to all of the hidden cameras. Then you notice a bunch of people with cameras are in the seats behind you. One of them comes up to you and says "Hi I'm John Qui√±ones, and this is 'What Would You Do' ".

Disclaimer: This was taken from a 1yo askreddit post; AOs of the sub, is it really like this?

<<I intern in the admissions office at a decently prestigious private California university and overhear the councellors making decisions. **They regularly shout stats across the office to get other people's input on whether or not to accept/deny applicants**. There was one kid who was right on the edge of what we normally accept--the lower end of the spectrum. My boss shouted out his stats and got mixed responses. Then she said the infamous phrase I'll never forget:

"but guys, I Zillowed his house, it's $4 million dollars in Los Angeles"

THEY FUCKING LET HIM IN. That was the determining factor for this kids COLLEGE CAREER. I will never forget sitting there in horror listening to them joke about his wealth. I have so little respect for college admissions, at least at my school, and the administration after hearing that.

Anyways, that's my yearly comment. Have a good night everyone üòÄ>>

**EDIT: I want to say I'm mentally stable for now. Thank you so much for your help everyone, and I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone. I'd like to cherish the time I have time left before losing my phone. Also, I disagree with the moderator's decision to disable comments in the other thread about conscription. Firstly, there is important advice and information other redditors can contribute. Secondly, I feel that we need a discussion bringing awareness to the topic. I know this is A2C, but I don't see how enabling the comments for some discussion can hurt. It's important to people like me, and young people concerned about social justice.**

I'm a male dual citizen and apparently they have guidelines not well known to the public that if you don't follow, you will be conscripted for two years even if you're not from Korea. I don't even speak Korean.

What do I even tell Brown? Do I need to apply again in two years with new essays and everything? Will my high school SAT scores and GPA still be valid??

They caught me at the airport and I had to get escorted. I'm so scared. I cried too much today and the staff here don't seem to care; no one asked if I was alright and just walked by me as if they were used to this scene. I had no idea this could happen to me; I was only on vacation. All of a sudden I'm going to be isolated from society in some military camp just because I'm a dual-citizen male who didn't renounce his Korean citizenship before March of the year I turned 18. I already looked my situation up, and apparently this happens very regularly to unknowing Korean-Americans like me, and the US doesn't do anything about it. It's a trap designed to get more conscripts, and I'm a victim. There's no escape.

I'm sorry that I'm going into venting mode right now, but it feels like I'm fighting a battle alone with no one besides me. No social movement even talks about conscription even though it's a blatant violation of gender rights and human rights. I literally feel so alone and it's painful.

I also feel stupid and embarrassed. I'll have to explain to my friends about how I was stupid enough to not know to renounce my citizenship. It's embarrassing. Also, in Korean culture apparently, if you complain about military service, you're not a "man" so you have to stay silent about it. This means I can't talk to anyone I potentially befriend in Korea.

I have to explain to my roommates why I can't attend. I even made tons of close friends from the Facebook page. I was so happy about going. My life was set. Now I'm in a situation that I STILL feel like has to be a nightmare.

I'm so glad I wrote this post and getting my emotions out, but at the same time, I feel like I wasted the little time I have left before I get transported and my phone taken away. I honestly think I'll try to kill myself. I've heard horror stories of hazing, abusive/violent superiors, intense training starting 6 AM, and how the two years go by extremely slowly. My uncle told me stories about how he was punished by being locked inside a gas room where it disabled his eyes and made him cough. And how he was outcasted (he's autistic) and beat by his soldiers at times. And how he slept the latest and woke up the earliest because soldiers said they'd kill him in his sleep, and he believed it. He said it psychologically changed him and he's the main reason why I'm so scared of the military. You also get paid $110 a month so it's not like the US military

Looks like my question post turned into a rant post. I'd be thankful for any help you can give me, and PLEASE some words of encouragement and emotional support. I also stopped crying writing this post. I should also say thank you since I'll be offline for two years; you helped me a lot through admissions and I'm so grateful you guys exist. I'm so scared and wish I could just die right now. Every person I see walking by makes me hyperventilate because I'm so scared they'll drag me away right now. Please help mr

## [How to write the Common App, University of California App, and Coalition App activities lists: a guide by Novembrr](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cxiez9/how_to_write_the_common_app_university_of/)
Struggling to write your activities lists? Here's a massive guide (an updated version of my old post) to writing them, utilizing my insight as a former admissions reader at UChicago and Berkeley, and a current college admissions consultant. Disclaimer: I'm not currently affiliated with the Common, UC, or Coalition applications or institutions.

If you‚Äôre applying to any UCs, I recommend you start with that list first (it has the longest character count for the description, and then you can cut down your descriptions to fit the Coalition and Common application restrictions).

*Overview for the Common App*

You have 5 slots for honors and awards, and 10 slots for your extracurricular activities.

The Common App requests that honors and awards be academic in nature, so most commonly students list AP Scholar and National Merit awards, academic awards given at school (such as English Student of the Year), awards on national foreign language exams, and so on. However, I encourage my students to stretch this to include awards for research, debate, FBLA, National History Day, and so on‚Äîif the honor/award was earned by using your brain, I would argue you can list it. From the admissions officer‚Äôs view when evaluating your application, this section does not mention ‚Äúacademic‚Äù. You must list your grades of involvement (you can select multiple grades), and the level of recognition (school, state/regional, national and international). If you have some spectacular honors and awards that aren‚Äôt remotely academic in nature, consider mentioning those in your activity description or additional information section.

You are given 100 characters to describe your honors. You are given 50 characters for the title/position of your extracurricular activity, and 150 characters for that activity's description/your responsibilities. Use your characters wisely.

You can use abbreviations. You can use & in place of and, Dir. in place of Director, 9-12 in place of 9th through 12th grades, and so on. There's no room for wordiness, but also strive for clarity. Don't use abbreviations or acronyms that an admissions officer would not know. You can also omit the final period but, if you do so, be consistent across all activities (no, you won‚Äôt be denied for inconsistent use of punctuation, but it just looks more professional!).

You do not need to fill all 5 honors/awards or all 10 extracurricular activities. You'll have to select a category for each extracurricular (academic, art, athletics: club, athletics: JV/Varsity, career-oriented, community service (volunteer), computer/technology, cultural, dance, debate/speech, environmental, family responsibilities, foreign exchange, foreign language, internship, journalism/publication, junior R.O.T.C., LGBT, music: instrumental, music: vocal, religious, research, robotics, school spirit, science/math, social justice, student government/politics, theater/drama, work (paid), other club/activity). In my experience, AOs didn't have a preference for the type of category you choose, but be as accurate as possible.

You'll have to select your grades of involvement (9th-12th, plus post-graduate if you have taken a gap year). You'll also identify your hours/week involvement, weeks/year, timing of participation (school year, summer, or year round), and whether or not you wish to continue in a related activity in college (marginally helps an AO envision you on their campus if you say yes, but don‚Äôt say yes for clubs you hate/have quit/don‚Äôt wish to continue).

*Tips for the Common App*

Be as descriptive as possible about your responsibilities. If you have recruited new members, how many? If you've helped fundraise, how much did you individually and/or collectively fundraise?

Put your most time-intensive and prestigious activities, and/or activities that most closely align with your intended major, at the top of your activities list. Societies and things you quit can go later in your list. Speaking of things you quit, try not to put an activity that you quit at the top of your application. If you quit something freshman year, you likely shouldn't include it at all, unless it's the most prestigious thing on your application, you didn't do many other extracurricular activities, or there are extenuating circumstances (like you used to be varsity captain of the football team until you broke your collarbone).

Don't overestimate your hours by lying, but don't underestimate your hours, either. If you are in a leadership position, don't just count the hours/week where you are at meetings but the time it takes you to prepare outside of meetings, as well. Do you run the social media pages? Make phone calls to find event spaces? Email group members? Create signs? Create curriculum/teaching materials? Mentor other members? Design t-shirts? Count that time.

Do you travel a long distance to practices? Count that time, as well. I once worked with a national figure skater who told me she only practiced something like ~15 hours a week. Later, I learned she traveled FOUR HOURS round-trip EACH DAY for practice. What an oversight not to include that time in her hours/week calculations! Luckily, she hadn't submitted yet and we included that time into her activities list. Travel to tournaments every weekend? Count that time.

Let's say you traveled to Nepal to volunteer. Count the flight time, but don't count sightseeing and sleeping time.

Let's say twice a year you travel to national debate tournaments, accumulating tons of extra time. However, during the regular season you don't do a lot of traveling, so your hours/week is much less than those two weeks in question. Let's say you compete 8 weeks. 6 of those weeks have 5 hours/week commitments, and 2 of those weeks have 30 hours/week commitments. (6x5) + (2x30) = 90 hours. Divide 90 by 8 and you get ~11 hours. Write down that you have an 11 hours/week commitment, but include in your description something like "Attended 2 time-intensive tournaments" to convey that you incorporated those huge time commitments into your hours/week averages.

Let‚Äôs say you have a time-intensive internship or job over the summer but continue during the school year with much more relaxed hours. Consider whether or not it makes sense to either a) average like my aforementioned suggestion, b) split the activity into two entries, separately listing your role/responsibilities for the summer and school year (and accompanying hours/week and weeks/year), or c) put either your summer or your school year hours/week and weeks/year numbers down officially, and write in the description ‚Äúan additional X hours/week and Y weeks/year work during 11th & 12th grades‚Äù, etc. You can also clarify details in your additional info section, but use this sparingly. Not only can excessive details annoy admissions officers, but AOs don‚Äôt read additional info at the same time as they evaluate your activities list (and assign it a rating). Thus, they might underrate your activities EVEN if you have context in your additional info section that would deserve a higher rating (and, because they are reading so quickly, they might not go back and amend their first impression).

One last word about hours/week and weeks/year involvement: let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre president of a club for the school year, but the club only meets once a month. Don‚Äôt say that your weeks/year involvement is 52 weeks. Just list the weeks in which your club actually met or you conducted some work on behalf of the club (it‚Äôs okay to estimate if you don‚Äôt have exact dates).

Have multiple leadership positions over the years within one activity? Put your senior year leadership position within your title and the other positions within the description. For example:

Captain, Varsity Soccer
Varsity captain 12th; Varsity player 11th; Frosh captain 9th, 10th. Led team to two state victories. Goalie with the most conference shutouts in '19.

If you've got fluff societies or fluff volunteering events, I recommend "bucketing" them (grouping them in related tasks). It's a better strategy than filling all 10 slots.

Instead of:

Member, National Honors Society
Attend monthly meetings and volunteer occasionally.
1 hr/wk
10 wks/yr

Member, Spanish Honors Society... and so on...

Say:

Member, Honors Societies
As a member of National, Spanish & Math Honors societies, I tutor other students & have volunteered at soup kitchens, park cleanups & with the elderly
3 hrs/wk
15 wks/yr

Instead of:

Volunteer, Friends Society
Volunteered 3 hours one Saturday making blankets for sick kids in the hospital.
3 hrs/wk
1 wk/yr

and so on with multiple volunteer orgs...

Say:

Volunteer, multiple organizations
Volunteered over 40 hours making blankets for hospitalized children, tending to donors at a blood drive, serving dinner to the homeless, and more
5 hrs/wk
8 wks/yr

*Overview for the University of California App*

There are 6 sections, and 30 slots total (for which you can determine how many slots to allot per section). Those 6 sections are:
* Coursework other than A-G: ‚ÄúThese are courses other than those required for UC admission (courses that do not fit in UC‚Äôs "a-g" subject areas)‚Äù
* Educational prep programs: ‚ÄúAny programs or activities that have enriched your academic experiences or helped you prepare for college.‚Äù
* Volunteer and community service: ‚ÄúThese are activities you've donated time and effort to without getting paid.‚Äù
* Work experience: ‚ÄúThis is for telling us about any paid jobs or paid internships you've had.‚Äù
* Awards and honors: ‚ÄúWe want to know about the awards and honors you've received that mean the most to you.‚Äù
* Extracurricular activities: ‚ÄúThese could include hobbies, clubs, sports or anything else you haven't had the chance to tell us about.‚Äù

You're given 30 characters to name the organization, course, or program. You're given 500 characters to describe your position, that activity's description, and your responsibilities. Use your characters wisely. Again, you can use abbreviations and acronyms.

You don't need to fill all slots. You don't even need to write anything for, say, work experience if you don't have any jobs that qualify.

*Tips for the University of California App*

Coursework other than A-G includes most classes you took in school that don't qualify as an A-G course (excluding health and physical education). The UCs say not to list courses in which you‚Äôre a teacher‚Äôs assistant, but I tend to suggest my students include them here (in my experience as an admissions reader for Berkeley‚Äôs Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, we were evaluating students on their leadership experience. TAing is a form of leadership, so it was something my colleagues and I appreciated seeing). Use your best judgment on whether or not to include being a TA here.

Other forms of coursework other than A-G include classes that you‚Äôre required to take in order to participate in some extracurricular activity (such as choir, orchestra, debate, FBLA, and so on). If you‚Äôve taken online classes for no credit (such as Coursera, EdX, MIT Open Courseware and so on), this is an excellent place to include that information (and, bonus, your desire to learn outside of the traditional classroom could net you one of Berkeley‚Äôs admissions criteria: ‚Äúintellectual independence‚Äù).

The UCs include a list of educational prep programs and, spoiler, those are ones they love to see on applications (so tell your younger siblings). Don‚Äôt panic if your educational prep program isn‚Äôt listed, as the UCs include an ‚Äúother‚Äù option where you can list your program.

Programs to include in this section are any summer camps or programs that are educational in nature, such as a business camp, leadership/public speaking/debate camp, an academic-focused camp (for instance, one in which you took a neuroscience course on a college campus), and possibly a research program. Alternatively, you can list research within extracurricular activities.

If you are low-income or first generation, definitely list educational prep programs, such as receiving a scholarship to attend a college essay writing or standardized test prep camp; for instance, a few years ago I taught at a college application bootcamp on UC Berkeley‚Äôs campus, and ~20 low-income, first-gen students had received scholarships to attend the pricey camp. If you fit into this criteria, listing these programs can serve as evidence of you going above and beyond community standards to pursue higher education. In contrast, if you are a high income student, I recommend you do NOT mention that you attended an SAT or college essay writing summer program, as those might signal to the UCs that you've had help studying for your SAT or writing your college app. If there‚Äôs a workshop included in a larger summer program (say, you attended a debate camp with a one-day SAT bootcamp), that‚Äôs fine to include.

Volunteer and community service is pretty explanatory, however, some of these activities might blend with your extracurricular activities (for instance, should National Honors Society be categorized as an extracurricular activity or volunteer/community service organization?). Choose the label that you think fits the best.

Work experience is anything that is paid. Spoiler alert: You also have to tell the UCs what you did with the money. I don't recommend that you mention you spent it frivolously. Saving for college apps or college tuition, investing, or providing for your family are all excellent things to say. If you really did spend it frivolously, perhaps twist it to say you spent your money on personal necessities.

For awards and honors, be descriptive. Don't just say you won the MVP award for your hockey team, but perhaps mention why you won it (for your defensive skills, because you're a lead scorer, etc.). If the award/honor isn‚Äôt self explanatory, explain it! Telling an admissions officer that you earned a Mustang Award in English tells them nothing; instead, say you earned a Mustang Award in your AP Literature class, awarded to the student with the highest grade.

As for hours/week and weeks/year, the same advice stands here as within the Common App section (so check out my advice above).

And as for the description for the UC Application, you have 500 characters. That sure feels luxurious compared to the two other apps! You don‚Äôt need to use all the space, but definitely take advantage of it. The UCs love specifics (all colleges do), so don‚Äôt forget to include #s, when applicable (the $ amount raised, the # of students led, the % by which you increased attendance as president, and so on). Mention your increase in responsibilities/roles over the years, and include some personal milestones (for instance, if you run track but never won any award, you can still mention how you set a personal record). You can also include some honors/awards within your description here, too, if you would like. So, if you‚Äôve won a ton of awards for debate, feel free to include a long list in your description, and perhaps leave your most prestigious (Tournament of Champions, NSDA nationals, etc.) for the honors/awards section.

*Overview of the Coalition Application*

The Coalition App provides space for 5 honors and distinctions, providing 64 characters for the title. If you can, sneak in a short description to provide context for AO (along the lines of what I instructed for the Common App above). You will also identify the level of the award (high school/local, district, regional/state, national and international). You have to identify the grade in which you received the honor or distinction and, unfortunately, they only allow you to select one year. You can pick the first year you received the honor and, space permitting, include in your title that you received it multiple years (‚Äú3x national champion‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúawarded 9th-12th‚Äù, etc.).

The Coalition App gives you only 8 activities, so consider combining some of them if you just cannot live without telling your Coalition schools about those extra activities. Of course, combine only related activities (honors societies, volunteer work, math and physics clubs, and so on). You have 64 characters to write out the name of your club or activity. Although the instructions state ‚Äúplease provide a one-sentence description of your experience,‚Äù the application provides 255 characters for your description.

Again, you will have to identify your grades of participation (only check ‚Äúpost high school‚Äù if you took a gap year), the hours/week and weeks/year of involvement. The Coalition App asks how many hours you spent in the activity on the low and high ends. I would try not to give a very low ball hour on the low end; if there‚Äôs some weeks where you only spend 1 hour, and most weeks you spend 8, average out to 7 and skip the high and low numbers altogether, as these sections aren‚Äôt required.

The Coalition App allows you to list honors and distinctions you received for each activity, so feel free to include a long list in this section (or expand upon the honors/distinctions you included in that section, if you didn‚Äôt have the space to do so there). You will also have to identify whether or not you have a leadership role, and how many other students share that role with you.

*Don‚Äôt have many/any extracurricular activities? Think again.*

Extracurricular activities aren‚Äôt just clubs at school. If you‚Äôve read the guide thoroughly, you‚Äôll have learned that internships, jobs, summer camps/programs, volunteering, etc. all count! If you took online classes, those count! Even activities the summer before 9th grade count, so feel free to include those. Here are some other extracurriculars to get you thinking:

* Reading
* Building things/tinkering
* Helping siblings (significant childcare, tutoring, or carpooling)
* Helping grandparents (helping them pay the bills, run errands, take their medicine, do chores)
* Helping parents (beyond typical chores; for instance, many first-gen children have to translate bills/phone calls for their parents)
* Caring for a sick or disabled family member
* Participating in a church youth group or in a religious ceremony each week (i.e. altar server)
* Any sort of job, including working in a family business
* Learning languages
* Hiking
* Yoga
* Attending a just-for-fun summer camp
* Running in your free time
* Drawing
* Babysitting
* Coding
* Knitting
* Gardening
* Scrapbooking
* Riding your bike
* Walking the neighbor's dog every day (not your own, if that‚Äôs a chore assigned to you)
* Helping your elderly neighbor with household tasks or errands
* Playing an instrument
* Playing board games
* Playing ultimate frisbee
* Skiing/snowboarding/other outdoor sports
* Fishing
* Writing short stories or poetry
* Conducting science experiments
* Working on a farm
* And so many more

Obviously, if you do these activities occasionally versus regularly, you aren‚Äôt likely to list them. But if you build a computer from scratch, and it was a huge undertaking, you can absolutely list that as an extracurricular activity. Think of things you do in your free time that are recurring each week or each month of the last few years.

And although I listed board games as an option, I don‚Äôt typically recommend students list video games unless they a) have won major awards, or b) are applying to video game production programs. Unfortunately there‚Äôs still a stigma surrounding them, so they‚Äôre best not included.

## [Underclassmen: STOP LURKING](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eu7w5a/underclassmen_stop_lurking/)
I totally get it. You‚Äôre aiming high, you‚Äôre nervous, and you want to be prepared, but for your own sanity you need to stay off A2C until you‚Äôre a senior.

Here are my reasons:

1) A2C will stress you out. It‚Äôs full of mostly overachievers who are stressed out about very minor flaws in their application. (No shade, love y‚Äôall) You‚Äôre going to get the same mindset if you spend too much time on here and start to look at things that are actually positives as negatives. (Ex: instead of being happy you got a 32 on the ACT, you‚Äôre sad you didn‚Äôt get higher)

2) Burnout. The college admissions process is LONG. I started Apps in August, and will be doing scholarship interviews in March. (Not to mention all the tours I did my Sophomore and Junior year.) It is simply a fact that you are going to get burnout. But ESPECIALLY if you try to start the college process too early.

3) It‚Äôs irrelevant. Like there‚Äôs so many underclassmen on this sub, but the vast majority of the information is totally useless to you. A thread about college interviews? You‚Äôll have forgotten it completely by this time next you. Decision date for a school you‚Äôre not interested in? So what?? Problem with college portal? They‚Äôll have fixed that glitch by this time next year.

4) Enjoy Highschool. Yes, highschool sucks, but that‚Äôs the period of your life that you‚Äôre in now. If you spend so much time worrying about and planning for college, you‚Äôre not going to take advantage of all the experiences highschool has to offer. Don‚Äôt spend so much time dwelling on the future that you forget to live in the present.

So when should you start?

A good rule of thumb is to not start your own college admissions process until the class above you has finished theirs. My advice would be to wait until after AP exams before you devote too much time to it, to avoid burnout.

In the meantime:

- participate in extracurriculars that actually mean something to you
- tour some colleges to get an idea about what you want in a school
- take classes that interest you and challenge you
- try to make the most of your highschool experience (it will be over quicker than you think)

To conclude, it‚Äôs awesome that y‚Äôall are putting in effort and care about your future, but do not cause yourself stress worrying about things that are a long way off. Make the most of wherever you are right now.

Edit: A2C is obviously a great resource for upperclassmen. (I wouldn‚Äôt be on here if it wasn‚Äôt)

## [How Coronavirus Might Impact Admissions: a post by a former UChicago/Berkeley admissions reader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fhgumf/how_coronavirus_might_impact_admissions_a_post_by/)
Many of you might *not* know me, as life circumstances led me to being pretty dormant on Reddit this past admissions cycle (sorry about that). But I'm Marcella (also known as Novembrr), a former admissions reader at UChicago and Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, and a college admissions consultant.

Naturally, I think many of you are worrying about how coronavirus might impact college admissions. I don't know for certain, as nothing is known for certain right now, but here are some of my thoughts.

[Here's a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19wJZekxpewDQmApULkvZRBpBwcnd5gZlZF2SEU2WQD8/htmlview) of all universities closed at the moment.

**For high school seniors and other applicants awaiting decisions:**

* Early to mid March is the season for admissions committee meetings. With universities closing their doors, it is probable that some universities' committee meetings were impacted, and I imagine many continued to work online. It is possible that some universities will be late in releasing admissions decisions this year. I am part of numerous online channels for admissions professionals, and have heard no official word regarding postponed decision dates. Be prepared for them to happen, however; if they do, I imagine the May 1st deposit date could get pushed back. Note: See comments for more opinions/details.

* As you all know, admitted student days are being cancelled or taken online. You can also find virtual tours on [CampusReel](https://www.campusreel.org/). If you do not have access to the internet at home, and thereby cannot make an educated decision about where you will attend college, consider reaching out to the co-leaders of the National Association for College Admission Counseling's [rural and small town special interest group](https://www.nacacnet.org/about/SIGs/rural-and-small-town/). Andrew Moe of Swarthmore is leading an initiative to share information with students offline. Even if you aren't from a rural area but are otherwise impacted by a lack of internet access, please contact Andrew. You could alternatively reach out to the leaders of the [special interest group](https://www.nacacnet.org/about/SIGs/) with which you most closely align to ask for help. I also know the irony of telling you to email someone about your lack of internet access :/

* If your family cannot afford to make a deposit to a university due to economic strain as a result of Covid-19 (or any other reason, for that matter), email the university to outline your family's circumstances and ask for an extension on the deposit deadline or reduction in deposit amount.

* If your grades suffer during this time (because of illness, financial instability, stress, etc.) and you are worried about being rescinded, write an email to the universities to which you're considering depositing (after you've been admitted) and provide them with context into your situation. No, this is not my permission to slack off, but don't overly stress about a situation that is outside your control.

* AP exams might be cancelled, which can unfortunately impact course credit in college. If your exam is cancelled, consider a) asking for a refund on any $ paid to College Board to register for those exams, and b) reaching out to the university at which you enroll to see if your grade in the class will confer any credit, in lieu of the AP exam score.

**For younger students:**

* You can check for SAT test site cancellations [here](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/test-center-closings). This list is slow to update, so please check individually with your test center.

* Do not panic if your SAT is cancelled; my hunch is more and more schools will go test optional in the year or two to come to accommodate for students impacted by Covid-19 test cancellations. At the very least, you can write an additional information statement on your college apps that outline how your test results were impacted by Covid-19.

* As a safeguard, I recommend that juniors (without test scores OR with test scores lower than their goal) investigate [this list of test optional universities](https://www.fairtest.org/university/optional) and add at least one to their college lists.

* Do not stress about visiting colleges to demonstrate interest. You can investigate whether a university even considers demonstrated interest in the admissions process by looking at their [common data set](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/wiki/common_data_sets). Once you're in a university's common data set, control + F for "Level of applicant‚Äôs interest" and you'll have your answer as to whether or not they even factor it into admissions decisions. Keep in mind, too, that there are other ways to demonstrate interest! Some colleagues at College Coach wrote this [helpful guide](https://blog.getintocollege.com/coronavirus-and-college-admissions-demonstrating-interest-without-visiting-campus/). At the very least, you can write an additional information statement for the university in question, describing how your plans to visit campus had to be cancelled.

* You can check out the aforementioned CampusReel for campus tours, but many universities have announced that they are working on recording their own virtual tours and information sessions online, so check universities' admissions websites regularly for those resources. I've also heard that some universities are doing regular Zoom/Facebook Live info session/Q&As, so consider registering for something virtual.

* Be prepared for summer programs to be cancelled. If they are, if you remain quarantined through the summer, or if you cannot or will not pay for expensive summer programs, consider taking free online courses through Coursera, EdX, MIT's OpenCourseware and other online sources. Reading, tinkering with electronics, perfecting a hobby, etc. are all reasonable summer activities.

* If you were selected to compete in some prestigious competition or attend some special program or event, and can no longer do so, you can include in your honors/awards section on college apps that you were selected/nominated for the award/competition/event, and/or provide that information in an additional information statement.

* AP exams might be cancelled. If they are, and aren't rescheduled for a later date this calendar year, consider signing up to take the exam *next* year. Like mentioned above, when you ultimately deposit to attend a university, you can also contact them to see if your grade in the AP class can confer credit. Would also be worth mentioning in your additional info statement in college applications that you were unable to take the official exam but practice exams had you scoring XYZ.

* For international applicants, the TOEFL might be headed [online, at home](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/03/10/ets-plans-toefl-home-coronavirus-affected-countries).

* Unfortunately, colleges might take massive hits to their budgets and could rebound by seeking to fill incoming classes with more full-pay applicants. If you can pay in full, great. If you can't, consider broadening your list to include need blind institutions and universities with higher acceptance rates at which you will qualify for large scholarships. My colleague over at My Kid's College Choice sells a [list of merit-based scholarships](https://www.mykidscollegechoice.com/full-scholarship-list/) at universities. I don't know her personally, but I've seen the list and it's fantastic.

**And for students in college/transfer applicants:**

* If classes are cancelled, dorms are closed, and you are unable to go home (you are an international student, you cannot afford to return home, home is not a safe place for you, etc.), please consider reaching out to your alumni association. Many alumni are rallying around current students to offer temporary housing, rides, food, storage, etc.

* If you applied to transfer and your mid-term grade reports are impacted by college closings, please contact the institutions to which you applied to ask for extensions/alternate options. If you have to return abroad, your timezone conflicts with the timezone in which your classes are offered online, and your grades suffer as a result, write a short extenuating circumstances essay and share that with those institutions, as well. On my online channels, I've seen multiple institutions pledge to accommodate transfer applicants.

* Updated to add: I just heard that the U.S. Student and Exchange Visitor Program has determined that, for students on F-1 visas, having to head home due to your university's closure will not be considered a violation of your F-1 visa. When the university resumes face-to-face classes, all F-1 students will be expected to return to classes. Please double check that information, as it's new to me!

**Final thoughts**:

I will try to update this post as I see more information come in regarding how Covid-19 will impact applicants and colleges. If I find any of this information to be outdated or incorrect, I'll delete those instances.

At the end of the day, I want you to stay safe and healthy; avoid situations that will put you, your family, friends or neighbors in harm's way; and avoid stressing about situations out of your control. As the parent of a medically-fragile kid, I worry about what's to come for our families and my heart aches for those already impacted. If all you brilliant pre-med kids can become epidemiologists, that would be great!

## [Hot take: Colleges know that many of their best applicants are "playing the game" and they accept them because most of college/life is "playing the game"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g0xhv8/hot_take_colleges_know_that_many_of_their_best/)
I'm sure colleges understand that there's many people who don't have an authentic passion and only found non-profits/take leadership positions in clubs/ etc because it'll look good. It makes sense for the college to accept these people because just like in undergrad admissions, they will likely know how to package themselves/resume chase in college and beyond. And, I presume, most colleges are okay with this, as it benefits them to have students that can land high status internships, regardless of authenticity.

## [they lied to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fz6nx9/they_lied_to_me/)
we all worked SO HARD in high school, always to be told to take the sidelines at rewarding events because ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get your chance when you‚Äôre a senior‚Äù and ‚Äúyour time will come.‚Äù Obviously no one could‚Äôve predicted this but I still feel lied to and cheated nonetheless. We‚Äôve had to watch every single class above ours get rewarded in so many ways and it sucks that we get nothing.

Class of 2020, we deserve everything that was planned for us and more. We won‚Äôt even get to say goodbye to our classmates or get our yearbooks signed or walk across the stage that we worked 12 years to get to. Fuck this #RIPClassof2020

EDIT: i didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up so much so i wanna clarify some stuff. this isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault and i‚Äôm NOT saying we should bring these events back. i am gladly staying home because it needs to be done. i also acknowledge that this is a first world problem and i am privileged that this my biggest worry and nothing worse. it is what it is, i am just saying it for those of us who are sad that it‚Äôs ok to be sad.

## [PSA: you CAN get into T20s without being seen as elite in middle school!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fg1xme/psa_you_can_get_into_t20s_without_being_seen_as/)
So unlike probably a lot of people on this sub, I was NOT one of those kids that took Algebra 1 in Eighth grade rather than in high school. All of my friends were on that path and pretty much everyone who was average at math or better at my school seemed to be on this path (yours could be different!)

I am a senior, and I am only in Pre-Calculus. Months ago I was really paranoid and asked both this sub and r/chanceme if I would be able to get into T20s without having been in calculus or even having the prerequisite for calculus; I got a resounding ‚Äúno‚Äù from pretty much everyone. Whatever, I still applied and worked my ass off on my applications.

So months pass and just a few weeks ago, I get my acceptance to Vanderbilt. What???

I got comments from these subs telling me that even as a social studies major I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get in because I wasn‚Äôt on that path. I applied *STEM* and got in!!

The school system likes to shit on us, and tell us how good we‚Äôll be at math in the future and decide what path we‚Äôll be on in High School as early as the 5th grade with no chance of mobility onto the upper path. I spent the entirety of my high school years regretting and being very upset about the fact that I was bad at long division in 5th grade and was consequently put on the ‚Äúdumb kids‚Äù path for the entire rest of my K-12 years.

It CAN be done. I wanted desperately my junior year to make up for my lack of rigor in math by doing well on the ACT section, and I still ended up with a 28 max on the math section because my school only catered to kids on the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù path for ACT prep. However, I was still damn proud of myself for getting a 28 math while i was only in the middle of Algebra 2. I managed to get a 35 or a 36 on every other section and get a 34 SS, and even though I only scored a 28 on math 3 times in a row, the ad board at Vandy apparently still saw something in me that they thought would lead to me being an incredible STEM student.

I will reiterate for the last time that IT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE DONE. I‚Äôm sorry if you were deemed ‚Äúdumb‚Äù in 5th grade and weren‚Äôt able to move into the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù path like I was, but if you show that you have kickass ECs, a passion for what you want to study, and a thirst to do well despite your circumstances, you will be OK!!

## [the year is 2023...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c10r9w/the_year_is_2023/)
the high school class of 2019 is gearing up to graduate- choosing grad schools, applying to jobs, saying goodbye to friends. they're so scared to leave, but so excited for what's coming next. on a whim born of nostalgia and emotion, they decide to check their old high school email addresses.

there's hundreds of new emails, but only from one source.

the university of kentucky extended their application deadline just *two more days*, and this exclusive offer is only for YOU. they've been extending your deadline for all four years. they never gave up on you, even when you might've given up on yourself. even without knowing it, the one constant in your life was your exclusive wildcat application, and now you've missed the chance to use it.

My clown of a friend put "certified cousin fucker" in her application as an award/EC (one of those) awhile back as a joke but she just realized that she didn't actually delete it. She got rejected from all of her common app schools and accepted to only the UC's, where she did not put that shit in her app. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. But don't fuck around and act like a clown.

## [Good morning, beautiful early birds!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dntyvt/good_morning_beautiful_early_birds/)
Good morning, beautiful early bird seniors.

It's been exciting seeing so many of you completing your early apps and getting them submitted! Congrats and good luck to you all.  üíô üçÄ

For those of you still in the weeds or even if you haven't yet begun to dive in üò≥, I want to remind you to take time today and the next couple of days to just breathe.  Write your little asses off and do the best you can, but remember to pause and breathe.

Here are a few more reminders for finalizing your early apps:

* DO NOT wait until the very last minute or even hour. Something will go wrong.  Your electricity will go out.  You'll come down with flu.  Internet will go out.  The zombie apocalypse will arrive. Your credit card won‚Äôt work. The website will crash.  Your pet will have a crisis. Try to give yourself a day, but at the very least give yourself five hours cushion time.

* Get up from your computer and walk around every hour or so. Go outside.  Let your brain reset occasionally.

* Be sure to preview your essays after loading them into the app, and see that the spacing is the way you want it. Chrome will automatically bold your essays. You can easily unbold.

* Read your essays OUT LOUD ‚Äî to someone else if possible. You will notice missing words and funny verb tenses.  Listen and feel for bumps. That‚Äôs where you need to edit. Make sure it sounds like you. Couple of hints I‚Äôve heard or read around here:
1. Read your essay to your phone recorder and then listen back for the bumps.
2. Print up the preview copies and read it to look for bumps and typos.

* If it sounds like you've swallowed a thesaurus ü¶ñ, go back and use words you know and understand.  It's really disconcerting as a reader to feel that bump with a word that just isn't right. Use words you know.  And understand.

 * Stop and breathe.  You might start feeling overwhelmed; just take 5 minutes and close your eyes and breathe.  You will be amazed at how much better you feel.

* In your essays, your tone should be casual and conversational. Like you‚Äôre talking to an older cousin you respect. It‚Äôs ok to use contractions. Eliminate adverbs, especially all verys and reallys.

* Be sure to preview your essays after loading them into the app, and see that the spacing is the way you want it.

* After submitting, look through and make sure all the parts went through.  Especially check to make sure that your supplements were submitted. You often need to go back and send them after paying and sending the common app.

* For deadlines of Nov 1, you have until midnight on Nov 1 ‚Äî do not wait until then to submit ‚Äî see my above notes about zombie apocalypses and websites crashing.

* For many colleges it‚Äôs ok for your supplementary materials like LORs, transcript, and test scores to arrive after the app. Check the colleges‚Äô websites to determine their deadlines.

* If you haven‚Äôt sent your test scores yet to schools that require official scores, do that today.

* Recognize that this learning process is what college admissions is really all about. Reflect on how much you are learning about yourself right now as you are going through this.  No matter where you go to college, you will be more in tune with who you are for having gone through this journey of self-exploration.  Be proud of it.

* This is the part you can control. Show them the best you on your very best day.

* Once you‚Äôve let those beautiful baby bird early apps go from your nest, let them fly.  Be sure to check up on your portals in the next few days and see what you need to finish, but beyond that move on to your other apps.

Ok!  That's a long enough procrastination break -- now giddy up; get back to work!  üëèüëèüëè

You got this!

Remember to breathe,

üíô admissionsmom

(Oh!  One more thing - try using Chrome if you aren't using it already and you're having trouble submitting üôÉ. )

## [giving up. thank you for everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fmxa4d/giving_up_thank_you_for_everything/)
my mom disowned me. after everything i tried to please her, i guess i wasn‚Äôt enough. even though i did everything i can, on my own, with no help from her, it seems like she resents me for trying to leave home.

i got into bu, gwu, stevens, umass amherst, but she doesn‚Äôt want me to go to america. she‚Äôs not paying for a single penny, she said. she already found me a work (under the table, less than minimum wage) job teaching children. i have to be there or i won‚Äôt get to come ‚Äúhome.‚Äù of course the money goes straight into her account, not mine. she said if i was on my best behavior, she would share some money with me. haha

i was happy that i got into those schools on my own. nobody knows anything about the us process, let alone speak english, and i‚Äôm the first to ever apply to any schools abroad, and i‚Äôm the first one to get into prestigious colleges. my principal called, she wants to have a chat with me, and congratulated me on my acceptances.

but now i can‚Äôt go. mom is forcing me to withdraw from all my colleges. she told me to shut my arrogant mouth, i‚Äôm not talented, i don‚Äôt deserve any of this. there is a mistake, why would they pick a stupid bitch to go to their college? she said.

i wondered why my parents separated. now i see why. she‚Äôs selfish. she didn‚Äôt have money to send me to the hospital for my ear infection, but somehow got a face lift & liposuction. hahahaha... my life‚Äôs a joke. what a cruel fate.

thanks everyone, i guess my college journey ends here. hope you get into your dream colleges.

meanwhile, i‚Äôll figure something out, don‚Äôt worry about me, i‚Äôm used to this.

## [PSA: The UCs Will Create the Hunger Games at your High School!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e3md5m/psa_the_ucs_will_create_the_hunger_games_at_your/)
I want to preface this post with saying that I am just a high school student who has heard this from an admissions offer during an admissions presentation at my school. They were very straightforward about the process ‚Äì no fluff or flowery appeals, just facts. This is coming from an Assistant Director of admissions at UCLA.

The UC deadline is tomorrow, so most of us are finished/finishing our apps. Here's information about the admissions process.

At UCLA, the admissions read by school. Not city, region, or state. **You are being compared to everyone else at your school**, not from anywhere else. Students from a high school even two blocks away will not be compared to your application directly. By reading by school, the UC admissions process selects the students with the best achievements, scores, grades, etc. (all of holistic ofc) from each school. If you go to a shitty public high school, you do not need a 1600 SAT and the cure to cancer to get in, since you are not compared to those who cured cancer at a private high school that costs as much as a college tuition to attend. You just have to have the best scores and extracurriculars out of your school.

That being said, **they do not have a quota per high school of people to accept**. If no one at a given high school is qualified to attend UCLA, they do not have to accept anyone. If 50 people are exceptionally qualified from a high school, they can accept all of them. But if 10 people apply from your high school and you are the top of your class, have the best test scores, extracurriculars, and passions, you have higher odds of being accepted to UCLA, even if other applicants from other high schools are better. This goes both ways: if 10 people apply from your school and the other 9 are ranked higher, better testing, and do more in their community, you have lower odds of being accepted, even if you are better than some other applicants. This is not to say you will or won't get in, however. In the end, it is up to the readers to accept or deny you based on what they are looking for in future Bruins.

UCLA is looking for the best and brightest from each school to fill their freshman class. They know that some high schools have more opportunities than others, and they take that into consideration in the admissions process. The admissions officer even prefaced telling us this by: "What I am about to say may create the hunger games at your school, but you guys are competing against only the people in this room, not even the high school down the street." I think this information should be spread.

&#x200B;

A few other tidbits from the presentation:

* UCLA does not care which major you are if you apply to the College of Letters and Science. If you are a Biology major, you will be reviewed the same as a Jewish Studies major. For the College of Letters and Science, you are only reviewed once: during the holistic admissions stage. This is not the case for the other colleges.
* For the School of the Arts and Architecture, Samueli School of Engineering, Herb Alpert School of Music, and the School of Theater, Film and Television, there are two processes in admissions. You must first make it past the general holistic process. Then your application is sent to the schools themselves, where they also take into consideration your supplements.
* For the arts, architecture, mustic, and theater, the supplements they look for are your portfolio or audition when deciding to accept or reject.
* For the school of engineering, your supplements are your SAT Subject Tests in Math II and a science subject test of your choice. So while "recommended", they are essentially required unless a hardship prevents you from taking them, in which case they would focus on your transcript and grades in STEM classes.
* The admissions officer was reluctant to give us this statistic, but for engineering admissions, they said that "sometimes, the median SAT Math II subject test for admits starts with an 8." Do what you will with that.
* The most competitive engineering majors start with "Computer". So, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science Engineering. No surprise there. However, the single most competitive engineering major is actually "Undeclared Engineering".
* Since they are a public school, they legally cannot admit more than 24% of out-of-state students. So, their admissions profile must be 76%:24% in-state:out-of-state or less. If you are in-state, you will never be rejected because an out-of-state applicant will have to pay more than you to attend. Their applications are read separately from in-state.

&#x200B;

This is all I can think of now, feel free to let me know if any of this is actually false, but I am pretty sure they said all of this. This all came from a UCLA officer, so it could very well be the same for the other UC campuses, but I am not sure. Hope this helps!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: UCs read by school, so you basically have to be one of the best in your school in order to get into UCLA. Engineering is hard to get into.

## [PSA: Don't complain about your school to your new college friends once you get on campus!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g9tcd0/psa_dont_complain_about_your_school_to_your_new/)
Please, please, please don't be one of those annoying people who shows up to campus in the fall and says "Oh, I wish I applied early to \[X\] school, I could have gotten in there so I wouldn't have to be here" or "This school was my safety" and stuff like that. Your second, third, or fourth choice school could be someone else's dream school. I read somewhere on this sub that some kids at Emory were talking about how they wished they'd applied to Duke ED so they didn't have to go to Emory, and I've heard that some JHU kids wear Harvard, MIT, and Stanford sweatshirts and talk about how they wish they could go to one of those. It's highly disrespectful and rude to ppl whose dream school was your school. So, don't walk around angry about getting rejected from whatever hyper competitive school you wish you got into. With an attitude like that, chances are you aren't taking advantage of all the amazing opportunities available to you in college.  (Also, your complaining could just perpetuate the stereotype of your school as a school for "Ivy rejects" anyway.)  It's impolite, mean, and honestly is something you should just keep to yourself (and don't even keep it to yourself - don't dwell on the past when you're in college). And, among the ppl on this sub, most of the time the schools that people are bitching about are AMAZING schools, like Emory and JHU.

Moral of the story: sadness/bitterness about being rejected is a valid emotion, but please don't wear it on your sleeve once you get to college, bc it diminishes the accomplishments of those around you and will likely prevent you from making the most out of your college experience!

## [PSA for procrastinators](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dc9j1x/psa_for_procrastinators/)
You may have less time than you think.

In a few weeks we're going to start seeing the posts.  "Does the deadline of November 1st mean midnight or 12:59:59? What time zone is that deadline?"  I know, I'm a procrastinator too.  You're going to want to squeeze out every second possible before submitting those applications. (and it usually means 11:59:59 in the time zone where the college is located)

Do yourself a favor and pretend the deadline is a day or two earlier though.  You may have less time than you think.

It didn't happen last year, but in the past the Common App has been swamped on deadline day and had outages and severe lag.  Some people say there were DDOS attacks two years ago, but it's hard to distinguish between DDOS attacks and a company just not having a robust enough server to handle additional load.  Be that as it may, this forum was filled with anguish as people watched their chance to submit an application in the early round slip away with 'unable to connect' and the spinning hourglass/rainbow circle.

Even if the Common App manages to handle the load, there are local outages that can hit you.  Transformers blow.  This time of year we can have windstorms and in the north we can get early snow.  Internet access dies at random for someone every year.

Don't let that happen to you.  Pretend that the deadline is October 30.

Because while haunted houses and FX zombie makeup can be scary, a complete lack of wifi signals on Halloween night when your application is due in the next hour is where you experience real fear.

## [The Ivy League vs The Techvy League](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f8dxcz/the_ivy_league_vs_the_techvy_league/)
After years of public pressure from pretentious high schoolers and their parents, the Ivy League - Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, and Dartmouth - finally voted to kick Cornell out of the Ivy League. In an official statement released to the press, Harvard, representing the League, explained that "Cornell had failed to maintain the humanities and liberal arts focus necessary to stay in the League".

Cornell supporters were devastated, claiming that this decision was an attack against Cornell's high acceptance rate and its mission to educate the masses. The Institutes of Technology - MIT, Caltech, GeorgiaTech - watched as the debacle unfolded. Together, they decided that they would do something to right the wrong.

On a Tuesday morning, Cornell received a phone call, "Hi Cornell, it's MIT. We have some things to discuss..."

Cornell arrived at The Conference. Inside, sat MIT, Caltech, and GeorgiaTech. "We've brought in some powerhouses to help us with what we're about to do", MIT announced.

Carnegie Mellon entered the room. UC Berkeley entered the room. Stanford entered the room.

A document was passed around, gaining signatures from each of the schools. On it, read "The reign of the Ivy-League ends today."

On September 1st, 2025, the Techvy League declared war on the Ivy League, flooding the airwaves with billions of negative attack ads.

MIT vs Harvard

Stanford vs Princeton

UC Berkeley vs Yale

CalTech vs Columbia

Carnegie Mellon vs UPenn

Cornell vs Brown

GeorgiaTech vs Dartmouth.

During the 2025-2026 admission season, acceptance rates for each of the Ivy League institutions rose to an all-time high while acceptance rates for the Techvy League institutions fell to a record low. Slowly but surely, Ivy League alumni stopped providing donations to their alma maters, and endowments at each of the Ivy League schools began to dwindle.

By 2033, 8 years after the war had started, the Ivy League surrendered. Running out of money and no longer able to fill their freshman classes, the Ivy League had come to the end of the road. Brown, Dartmouth, UPenn, and Columbia had already boarded up their campuses while Harvard, Princeton, and Yale pleaded for mercy. None was granted.

In 2035, the Ivy League institutions are nothing but a memory. The Techvy League - MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, CalTech, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, and GeorgiaTech - reign supreme.

## [On the failure of college counselors in low income areas](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dbzg0e/on_the_failure_of_college_counselors_in_low/)
Short rant here and a request for advice. My husband and I are early thirties professionals who had the privilege of studying at and interviewing for Yale, and he currently runs a real estate investment company. For the last year or so, we have been mentoring the daughter of one of his construction workers who is a college senior applying for schools from a public high school in a low income area near us. The ‚Äúcounseling‚Äù this girl has been getting is INFURIATING. She is extremely smart, good grades, and a Latina first generation (prospective) college student interested and passionate about SCIENCE and STEM in particular.  In other words, she is everything that any great school would be lucky to have. Today she‚Äôs texting me nonstop about how her college ‚Äúcounselor‚Äù won‚Äôt let her take AP bio, chemistry or physics because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much science‚Äù, and that she is being forced to take another year of language, an art class, and a personal finance class instead. She‚Äôs ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù to study for and take APs outside of the school‚Äôs curriculum and if she doesn‚Äôt take the classes the counselor ‚Äúrecommends‚Äù the counselor won‚Äôt ‚Äúlet‚Äù her apply to any schools. The counselor also CROSSED OFF the top three dream schools on her list, which she is imminently qualified for, because she ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt had three full years of Italian, so they won‚Äôt take you.‚Äù She is recommending she set her heart on some TRULY shit schools in her backyard. This experience has truly made my blood boil and shed a big light for me on the way that privilege has worked to benefit me my entire life. Access to good, sound counsel and good teachers who have encouraged me to pursue my wildest dreams has been something I‚Äôve always been lucky to have. I cannot imagine the difficulties and barriers that kids in schools like this have overcome in order to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù into top schools. Game plan going forward: we are getting her set up with a common app account OUTSIDE of school, husband and I are looking at her essays and fronting the application fees for 10 good schools, and we are going to help her sign up for and get prep books for a few AP tests she can take and study for on her own.  We have also offered to pay for a community college online Bio class so she can show colleges she is serious even if her schedule doesn‚Äôt show it for matters outside her control. We also solicited her parents help to set up a meeting with the principal of the school tomorrow AM to see if we can get her assigned a different counselor and if they‚Äôll be flexible and let her take classes she is interested in. Anyone who has come up in a school like this and made it to better pastures in spite of ‚Äúcounselors‚Äù like this‚Äîplease tell me what helped. What more advice can I pass on to this young lady?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone!. We met with the school principal, assistant principals, and head guidance counselor today. Outcome: the student has been reassigned to work with a counselor that she gets along well with and will advocate for her. My husband and I are coming in to the school at the end of the month to meet with students and counselors and discuss some of the misconceptions some people might have about what these types of schools are looking for and the financial aid that can be available at top schools.

## [I visited 100+ top colleges, 360¬∞ campus tour videos of each are on Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ftvyu3/i_visited_100_top_colleges_360_campus_tour_videos/)
Three years ago I began visiting colleges with a 360 camera so my students could see the campus without having to fly there. Now these videos are all on Youtube so you can visit them without leaving home!

&#x200B;

The Art of College: [https://www.youtube.com/c/theartofcollege](https://www.youtube.com/c/theartofcollege)

Website: [artofcollege.org](https://artofcollege.org)

(**please** spread the word by hitting that like button, leaving a comment, or sharing on your social media!)

&#x200B;

**In each video, there are some stats by "looking down":**

\- USNews undergrad rank from 2010 - 2015 - 2020

\- Full undergrad cost of attendance. I couldn't find this info aggregated anywhere so I went to every school's website and added tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year.

\- Average undergrad starting salary from Payscale.com

\- SAT ranges (new 1600 SAT)

\- Undergrad early and regular deadlines

\- Nearest major city and relevant stats

&#x200B;

**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**

\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I felt really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a "feel" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.

&#x200B;

**For more immersive playback**

1. Youtube defaults to 720p ‚Äì 1080p playback, which is too low for 360¬∞ video. Click the settings icon and change to 4k for MUCH better quality.
2. Playback on your phone/ipad tends to be much smoother than playback on PC (unless your PC has dedicated graphics card)
3. For wider field of view, play back on your computer in full screen mode (F11) and scroll down on your mouse. You‚Äôll get about 1-2 notches on your scroll wheel before the page itself starts to scroll down. This is the widest field of view, press Page Up to go back up to the top of the video and enjoy the wider field of view!

## [How fucked am I?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/btiouj/how_fucked_am_i/)
Hey guys. I'm 17 years old. This is going to be a long post and probably extra sentimental cus it's 3 am when I'm writing this shit

I used to be a model student. I came to highschool and I got a 3.8 GPA freshman year ( yeah not like those 4.0 UW people on chanceme ) my only goal was to get into NYU. I joined many clubs and did them well I think.

I also met a girl that I utterly fell in love with. I finished with super high grades and I was on track to NYU. Also, I'm a poor ass boi from the Bronx and the first person to attend a college ( hopefully lol ) I got super high grades in the regents too ( NYC mandated tests )

Then, during the summer. I did something bad, I fucked up super badly. I lost the girl I love and I also potentially could have lost my life because I joked too much and got out of my lane.

I fell into a deep depression and wanted to kill myself. Sometimes I wonder how I have the mental strength to survive through a time like that. I barely ate and only slept

Sophomore year, my grades flunked so badly it's not even funny. I fucked up. I failed. 65s in algebra. 3.8 gpa to 3.2-3

Junior year, I went back. My GPA was back to a 3.9 and I got a 1480 ( first try :D ) on the SAT. I also joined many clubs and will be doing a summer internship.

My question is, is my dreams of NYU done? I promised my dad I would get in there and make our dreams come true. I want to be a lawyer ( please don't judge me now lol ) and as immigrants, it would make my dad's American dream complete. I just wanna see his face light up for one last time ( he too has depressions and horrible health problems; runs in the family I guess )

I'm just scared sophomore me ruined those dreams

Please help me guys, I'm clueless.

I have dreams to go to Harvard and Yale for postgraduate work and many teachers have cheered me on. It's my only dream. Education is the only way I can escape the shit fuck that is the Bronx

Reading ChanceMe makes me think I'm worthless. I'm not here for pity. Please be as realistic as possible. Its given be anxiety thinking about college. I feel like a modern Holden Caulfield

I need advice

Peace and love

- confused boy

Edit: wow this really blew up... I just want to thank each and every one of you who wrote something. It truly means a lot. I've just read every single comment and it brought me to tears. I've learnt a lot from this post alone. I think I'm gonna have to good talk with my family. At the end of the day, NYU would be nice but there are too many factors to think about before even applying to college, sadly money is one of them. I'll update you guys one day in the future about what happened to me. Thanks so much once again

## [Words from a parent of T20 qualified kids. Make the best of your situation!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fo9p0v/words_from_a_parent_of_t20_qualified_kids_make/)
Parent here of two kids who got into Purdue and UMich and got rejected from MITx2/UIUC/Stanfordx2.

If you are in the mix and have the stats and have a chance to afford it, you've got to apply. You owe it to yourself to take your shot and while you are likely to be rejected, you gave yourself a shot.

My father and I both graduated from MIT and my kids were hit hard when they got rejected, but they were in the arena and had a legitimate chance to make it. 1960s MIT was very different from 1980s MIT, which was very different from today's MIT, but I would have done anything to have my kids go there.

That being said, you shoot your shot and you make the best of where you end up. There is way too much emphasis on picking your 'fit' in advance. More emphasis should be placed on resilience and deciding that where you end up is the 'right' place. Lay your acceptances out in front of you and pick the best academic/financial/future prospects place for you and the \*decide\* that your choice will be your future.

Make it your place for success.

My son ended up transferring out of Purdue. My Daughter is navigating the virus at Michigan, but I am confident that they are both finding their way through the vagaries of life, starting in college. Life will never follow your plan. You are best served by picking your best option at the given time and planning to adapt to what life presents to you.

You have done well to be in the mix. Enjoy the excitement and then deal with the results. You'll be at a great place and its up to you to make the most of it!

Sincerely, someone else's Dad.

In about half a year, our applications will be done. I know it seems like a long time, but our high school career has gone by with the blink of an eye. Suddenly, we're all seniors. Suddenly, we're all adults. And in at most 264 days from now, you'll be saying "I have proudly committed to \_\_\_\_\_\_'s Class of 2024." Hold your head up high and keep your expectations low. Only then will you be content with the final results, no matter what they are.

Class of 2024 Forever <3

I‚Äôm going to be the first student from my school to go to an Ivy in the past 25 years ‚Äî let alone Harvard.

This doesn‚Äôt even feel real... my grandma cried on the phone when she found out and all my past and current teachers are congratulating me. ü•∫

I couldn‚Äôt have done it without my amazing counselor. She went to bat for me in that recommendation letter, and Harvard ended up calling about me back in February and she praised me to the high moon. I wish I could thank her and my teachers in person, but I suppose emails will have to do.

Thank you to everyone on this sub, too. This is probably the most useful source for admission advice on the entire internet, barring private paid counselors. Really, you all are amazing. I wish you all the best ‚Äî i know wherever you end up you will all do well.

Peace, everyone. :)

## [5 Mistakes You are Making when Reaching Out to Colleges/Universities for T-Shirts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eswxt1/5_mistakes_you_are_making_when_reaching_out_to/)
Hi. I‚Äôm an Admissions Processor from a small private university in Southern California. I assist the Admissions Counselors by processing applications and student documentation. A few months ago I was handed the responsibility of managing our admissions email account.

In the first couple of days managing our email account I realized that we received an incredibly high amount of requests for T-Shirts and paraphernalia.  I get 10-20 a day, 60-100 a week. It‚Äôs more than any other email I receive including our regular applicants needing help with their applications. Furthermore, the emails were so similar in their format that I was compelled to look into it more deeply. After a hour or two of searching I found three things: 1. A YouTube video about how to get ‚Äúfree‚Äù shirts from universities 2. A viral blog post about a high school student who sent a thousand emails to schools requesting T-Shirts, which influenced the YouTube video I had found and 3. This subreddit which had a recommended email template that I have seen word for word over a hundred times.

I have to admit, I ignore these emails. I have an automatic response set up to respond to them on my behalf. Truth is, I don‚Äôt have shirts to give. We are a small school so we have limited resources. All the paraphernalia we get are for counselors to bring on the road when they visits schools. We also have a set few things to give when students come in for tours or to mail to students who have been accepted. We run out of those stuff fast and the counselors constantly complain that we need to order more for them. Even then none of that material includes T-Shirts. We have like one box of old shirts with outdated logos that I can give to applicants on request, but once those run out we won‚Äôt have anything. Other than my staff shirts, I get shirts when they go on sale at the bookstore just like the students.

That said, I wanted to let you in on some of the biggest mistakes you are making from an Admissions perspective based on my experience of receiving these emails:

Mistake #1

You are forgetting to BCC all the schools you are emailing to.

Make sure when you export your excel sheets that don‚Äôt show that you sent your email to 100+ schools. I get this multiple times daily. Probably half of them. I can see the other schools you sent the same exact email too, so I know you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúnarrowing your choices down‚Äù and need my shirts to help you decide or that ‚Äúyou heard about [our] campus and are interested‚Äù so you want to ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù us or ‚Äúshow school pride!‚Äù. I have even ended up multiple times in a chain of responses from other schools letting students down. BCC the email addresses of the schools so it at least looks like you sent it to one school. *** Also, make sure your email subject doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúSending emails from a Spreadsheet‚Äù I get 2 or 3 of those a week.

Mistake #2

You are using an overdone email template.

Create an original email (and stop using those templates!) I can‚Äôt tell you how many times a day I see the subject ‚ÄúAn unusual request‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even know where this comes from, but I get it so often that I can assure you that the request isn‚Äôt even slightly unusual. Also you can‚Äôt all be the leader of your Spanish Honor Society and have 4.0 GPAs. Take some time to think about what you will say and create a really honest and unique email that will say something so different from the templates that we see everyday that we might actually think your email is genuine. You might even get a shirt for the creativity.

Mistake  #3

You are not putting enough thought into the body of your email.

This goes in the other direction as well. If you are not going to use a template at least use the standard ‚ÄúDear Admissions Team, [INSERT WELL WRITTEN PARAGRAPH] Thank you, [NAME]‚Äù Every day I get at least one person who sends just a sentence that says ‚ÄúI like your school can I have some free stuff like a T-Shirt? My address is: [ADDRESS]‚Äù If you don‚Äôt care about your email, it‚Äôs hard for an admissions rep to think you actually care about their school. ***Another note: If you are not going to say the specific name of the university, say "Dear Admissions Team". Please do not say "Dear University" its an instant red flag that you don't even know who you emailed.

Mistake #4

You are not proofreading your emails before sending.

Take an extra minute before sending to check for grammar and spelling issues. A little bit of editing goes a long way. It just looks a lot better. It‚Äôs also good practice for when you are in college too because professors are going to be a lot harsher on those things the further you go into your degree. It‚Äôs something that I had to get used to doing myself.

Mistake #5

You are not personalizing your emails.

Send personalized emails to a smaller set of schools that are well known for sending gear. If I get someone who emails me specific information such as ‚Äúoh I used to live in the area (and can name it)‚Äù, "I really like [INSERT PROGRAM NAME] because I want to do [INSERT RELATED JOB] or ‚Äúoh I came on a campus tour and really enjoyed meeting with [INSERT COUNSELOR NAME] I‚Äôm a lot more likely to dig through my stuff to find something to send to that student because they seem genuine. If someone wants to take the time to pool together which schools they received gear from and narrow that list down that would help us counselors a lot and probably be just as successful (or even more) for you guys. Maybe even slow down that YouTube video and see which boxes he received stuff from and put those schools down on the new list.  Yeah it‚Äôs a bit of extra work, but that extra hour of time is going to yield much better results.

That‚Äôs all I have for now. Hopefully you can take this advice into consideration and get more responses from the colleges and universities that you are reaching out to!

Edit: Today I received an email from a fellow university that CC'd all of the other 1,000 schools caught up in the "T-shirt scam" linking the youtube video and telling us to not fall for it. I checked the video again and turns out it was recommended again 1-3 months ago and therefore has had a resurgence, explaining the increase in emails over the past few months. Additionally, I discovered the "Unconventional Request" template comes from this video, which explains a-lot. My point remains the same however, pretty soon you wont be getting any response from universities that you request T-shirts from, so you should probably only request shirts from schools you have applied to or are admitted to. If you send them a personalized well written email then you may get a positive response.

[My friend thinks](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cn4hlx/what_do_i_do_about_friend_who_thinks_duke_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) Stanford is real and is only applying there. I keep trying to tell him to look at other schools because Stanford doesn‚Äôt exist. What should l do? His stats are in top 25% for t20s.

## [Unpopular Opinion: Stop Assuming Every Rejection is a Yield Protect](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fi1fvc/unpopular_opinion_stop_assuming_every_rejection/)
First of all, I‚Äôd like to congratulate everyone who got accepted to UC Davis and all the other schools that came out yesterday. Don‚Äôt let anyone diminish your accomplishments.

I‚Äôve seen around 30-40 different comments and posts about individuals attributing their rejection to yield protection. While yield protection is theoretically a possibility, I refuse to believe that everyone in this sub was rejected due to yield protect. Just because you have high stats and got rejected does not mean you got yield protected. I know it sounds mean, and I apologize, but unless you created a vaccine for coronavirus in your garage overnight, I doubt you got yield protected. Yield protection isn‚Äôt even a confirmed practice and I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as common as everyone thinks it is. The plausible reality is that a UC Davis AO simply didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd make a good fit in the student body. And this DOES NOT mean you‚Äôll get rejected to other UC schools either. They‚Äôre all different.

Also please stop saying that UC Davis was your safety school. Unless your Albert Einstein‚Äôs direct descendant I really doubt a school with a 41.2% acceptance rate is considered a safety.

Thank you & good luck with your other admissions!

## [You're not wasting your time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e4lbef/youre_not_wasting_your_time/)
With early decisions coming out soon, the stress level on this sub has spiked. People post stuff like this:

>We all try so hard here for that 1600, 4.0, EC, jobs, etc for college and many of us...will go to a state school like everyone else who didn't try. We'll have everything we did for nothing. I feel like if I get rejected from T20s, I've accomplished nothing. My time has been wasted and I would have been in the same school if I had done nothing.

That got upvoted to hot. I'm not trying to call out OP, just point out that the sentiment is alive and well on this sub.

But it shouldn't be. **You might go to the same school as your less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills.**

# Scholarships

Thinking plainly, if you're going to your state school but you're competitive for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free, or close to it.

You might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35, when all of your debt-ridden classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to grad school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.

# Honors Programs

Any state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the perks:

* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.
* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.
* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.
* **Honors classes/seminars.** Not a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.

# Advanced Standing Opportunities

You know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take "Intro to Physics" as an English major.

For me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.

# Resume and College ECs

No matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.

That stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen, or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.

That experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.

# You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.

If you don't believe me (understandable, I'm a high school junior; what do I know?) listen to [this guy at UCF who posted something along the same lines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ac881h/on_ending_up_in_the_same_place_as_someone_who_put/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) *Shoutout to* u/Vottle_of_Bodka *for pointing out this post.*

Today was so weird. Everyone was in school just existing, it just felt a little off. Coronavirus is messing with the matrix.

## [For the love of God, people. APPLY TO SAFE COLLEGES](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edcjbn/for_the_love_of_god_people_apply_to_safe_colleges/)
Seriously, there's still plenty of time to apply. I keep seeing posts about people saying they're not getting anywhere because they only applied to super elite schools and didn't get into any. There are other colleges, you know. 

Apply to safe colleges, if you still really want to go to the one you got rejected from, go to the safe college and get really good grades, reapply, and transfer. The only way that you can be a failure after getting rejected from all of your choices is if you choose to literally not do anything else. 

As long as you get a degree, people really don't care where it came from as long as it wasn't a trash college. Also, just because it isn't ivy league doesn't mean it's trash. There are plenty of schools that are better and have better outcomes and aren't ivy league, ivy leagues are essentially the brand names of colleges. It's the same thing, packaged differently, and harder to get.

Edit: excluding the jobs that require an ivy league degree (stuff like Wall Street), most jobs won't not hire you because you didn't get an ivy league degree. 

Moral of the story: if you got rejected from all of your colleges, life isn't "over", apply to a school you CAN get into and either get your degree there or transfer. Transferring is hard and unlikely, but it's not possible at all if you don't try. Even if you don't get in, you'll still get a degree.
